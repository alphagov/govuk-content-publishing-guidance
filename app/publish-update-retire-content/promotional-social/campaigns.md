Campaigns are not published on GOV.UK but on separate ‘campaign.gov.uk’ campaign sites.

These campaign sites can be:

- single-page sites, like the [Best Start in Life campaign](https://beststartinlife.campaign.gov.uk/)
- multi-page sites, like the [Ready to Pass? campaign](https://readytopass.campaign.gov.uk/)

Read more about the requirements for campaign sites on the [Government Communication Service (GCS) website](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/marketing/how-to-set-up-a-new-government-campaign-online/).

## Create a campaign site

Talk to GCS as early as possible. This helps formal approval processes later on.

Before asking for a campaign site, think about:

- whether you could direct users to existing content instead – you might just be adding an extra step between the user and the content they need
- whether your campaign site will be competing with existing guidance – more established pages will likely rank higher in search

You should also read the guidance on what to do before you apply on the [GCS website](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/marketing/how-to-set-up-a-new-government-campaign-online/).

When you’re ready to create a campaign site:

1. Get approval for your campaign from your organisation’s head of communications. They can help with your application.
2. Ask your head of communications to submit a [campaign request form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/campaign_request/new) for you.

GCS will review your request. You should get a decision within 10 working days.

The review process will include consideration of the following 5 topics. 

### 1. User need

Is there evidence of user need or that the audience will be receptive?

Is there user research pointing to the likely success of a government-run campaign site?

Is the user journey clear and coherent?

> We recommend that a content designer in your organisation reviews the content and advises on how your site can best meet user needs.

### 2. Campaign plan

Does the campaign include steps for objectives, audience insight, strategy, implementation and scoring (OASIS)? Read more about [campaign planning](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/guidance/campaigns/guide-to-campaign-planning-2/).

### 3. GOV.UK 

Would it be better to link to existing GOV.UK content?

Does it duplicate information already on GOV.UK? The campaign must not duplicate other content or services on GOV.UK. Read more about [what does not go on GOV.UK](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/plan-new-govuk-content/).

Is it within the [GOV.UK proposition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition)? You must follow the guidance in the proposition when you publish content. 

Does it link to a service on GOV.UK? If it does, make sure you link directly to the start point. Read more about [start points for GOV.UK services](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/start-using-a-service/)

Does it link to an external site? If so, you must follow the [guidance on linking to non-GOV.UK websites](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/add-links/).

### 4. Alternatives 

If not suitable for a GOV.UK campaign platform site, could the aim be achieved using partner sites?

Can campaign goals be achieved by using existing social media tools and communities, rather than creating a new destination?

Learn more about how to use these channels by speaking to your comms team, or read the [Social Media Playbook](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-playbook).

### 5. Exemptions

If your proposed site does not meet the requirements for campaign sites or a campaign site would not meet your requirements, you will need to get approval from the Government Digital Service (GDS) before you create any new government website or public-facing domain.

Find out how to [ask GDS for a GOV.UK exemption](LINK).

## Create a short URL

It helps to have a memorable short URL for campaigns. 

[Ask GDS to set up a short URL](LINK) for your campaign site.

## Create accompanying GOV.UK content

You might want to support your campaign site with content on GOV.UK, including:

- promotional material [publications](LINK), for leaflets, posters, fact sheets and marketing collateral
- [document collections](LINK), if you want to collect together multiple promotional material publications
- [topical event pages](LINK)

## Manage your campaign

Every campaign must have a named owner. They will be the main point of contact with GDS.

Your department's communications team is responsible for campaign sites. But involve your digital team early on to ensure a joined-up approach.

The campaign owner will be responsible for:

* ensuring the campaign site does not duplicate information already on GOV.UK
* setting an end date for the campaign, if it’s a rolling campaign, set a review date 
* helping and training people to publish to the campaign platform
* ensuring content follows the [style guide](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) and [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/)
* making sure the site follows the [design principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles)
* evaluating the campaign’s performance using Google Analytics and other available data
* submitting your analytics and statistics to GCS at regular intervals
* ensuring the content meets [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/) standards - see [accessibility on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility) 

GCS will:

* manage campaign request tickets
* assess your site and decide if it’s suitable to go public
* review your sites six months after it’s live

GDS will:

* maintain the availability and security of the campaign platform
* set up new administrator accounts
* work with GCS to review and prioritise requests for new accounts and additional functionality on the platform

Six months after your site goes live, you'll be required to provide performance data for the site based on your digital Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). If the campaign does not meet its success criteria, you must create a plan to improve it. 

### Use the GOV.UK campaign platform

GDS provides the WordPress platform to host campaign sites. 

If your campaign site is approved, the campaign owner will be sent details to sign in to your account.They are responsible for using this to manage and monitor the campaign.

When you sign into the platform there are links to the [government campaign user guide](https://userguide.campaign.gov.uk/) which explains how to set up the platform.

## Close a campaign site

1. Contact your head of communications before closing your campaign site.
2. Agree on where your campaign URL should redirect to. The page will need to be archived and URL redirects set up.
3. Ask the lead to [make a support request](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/unpublish_content_request/new) to close the campaign and set up a redirect.
