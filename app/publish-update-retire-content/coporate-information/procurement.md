description: Learn when and how to publish a procurement page.

Use a procurement page to:

* let businesses know, as clearly and concisely as possible, how to start selling goods and services to your organisation
* link to current opportunities

Do not use it for:

* guidance on invoicing (suppliers can get these details from your purchasing orders)
* anything about spending data (that’s covered elsewhere on GOV.UK)
* providing lots of information about processes
* general information about government procurement policy - for example, the obligation to publish details of central government contracts (that’s covered elsewhere on GOV.UK)

Explain the process in neutral terms. Do not attempt to ‘sell’ the organisation as a business partner.

Include just enough to let potential suppliers take the initial step. Suppliers can be given more detailed information as they move through the procurement process.

If you create a procurement page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

## What to include

Use this text for the summary:

> [!NOTE]
> Supplying goods and services to [your organisation name].

You must include a section called ‘Doing business with [your organisation name]’. In it, tell people what to do if they want to become a supplier. Depending on the organisation, this might mean:

* linking to the place where your contracts are advertised (for example, [Contracts Finder](https://www.gov.uk/contracts-finder))
* explaining how to sign up to the organisation’s tendering system
* providing an email address for procurement enquiries

### Optional information

If the organisation has them, you can attach a document or link to your:

* standard supplier terms and conditions
* procurement policy

You can also include information telling people what to do if they have a complaint about how the organisation has dealt with them as a supplier. Only include this if it’s different from the organisation’s general complaints procedure.

If the organisation publishes information on how it’s improving procurement practices (for example, sustainable procurement commitments) you can link to it here. Link to this information rather than including it on the page, so the procurement page stays focused on practical guidance for potential suppliers.
