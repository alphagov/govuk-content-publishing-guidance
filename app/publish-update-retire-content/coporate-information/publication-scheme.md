A publication scheme lists the classes of information that the organisation makes available. Most government organisations are required to have a publication scheme.

Publication schemes follow a template set by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Use the text included in the next section and where appropriate:

* add in your organisation’s name or acronym
* replace the links with the relevant link for your organisation (this includes links to external URLs and links to filtered search pages)
* create documents or document collections and add links to them

You can make small changes to the text and add or delete links and categories where these apply to your organisation.

When you create a publication scheme, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

## Publication scheme template

This publication scheme specifies the categories of information that the department and its agencies regularly publish and explains how to get that information.

You can find specific documents for this department using the [publication search](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?organisations[]=department-for-education&order=updated-newest&parent=department-for-education). 

If the information you want is not routinely published, you can [make a request for it](https://www.gov.uk/make-a-freedom-of-information-request) under the Freedom of Information Act.

You can also search through [previous responses to Freedom of Information requests](https://www.gov.uk/search/transparency-and-freedom-of-information-releases?content_store_document_type=foi_release&keywords=) (or amend this filtered search so it returns results for your organisation alone).
