Use the ‘About our services’ page for: 

* service level agreements
* service standards

Do not use it for:

* your general approach to customer service
* general information about your services

For general information about your services use the services and guidance links or ‘About us’ page. To explain your approach to customer service, use the complaints procedure instead.

If you create an ‘About our services’ page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.
