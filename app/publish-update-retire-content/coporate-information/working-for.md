Use a ‘Working for’ page to describe:

* what sort of roles you might recruit for
* the benefits to working for your department, such as travel, holiday, pension
* training and development opportunities
* the benefits of working for the Civil Service
* a link to Civil Service recruitment or other relevant recruitment websites

If you create a ‘Working for’ page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘About us’ pages.

{% include "reusable-content/corporate-info-style-tone.md" %}
