Some content types are for information about government organisations, or people working across government. 

These are:

* [group pages](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/groups/) (for groups within organisations, such as policy advisory groups)
* [organisation pages](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/organisations/) (such as departments, agencies or arms length bodies)
* [people and role pages](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/people-roles) (such as ministers or senior department staff)
* [worldwide pages](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/worldwide/) (which cover UK government organisations that operate abroad, news stories about the work they do and links to services they run)
