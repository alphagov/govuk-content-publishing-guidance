Some content types do not follow the same common processes as the 'standard' content types. Some have different features, such as a postcode search function or collapsible headings, or use different publishing applications. These types are:

* [‘Find my nearest’ pages](link tbc)
* [licence pages](link tbc)
* [local transaction pages](link tbc)
* [manuals](link tbc)
* [specialist finders](link tbc)
