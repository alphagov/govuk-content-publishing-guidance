## When to use 

Use statistical data sets for data that you publish monthly or more often without analysis, like raw data.

For data sets you publish less frequently or with analysis, use [statistics content](LINK) instead.

## Create a draft

To work on a statistical data set, you’ll need a [Signon account with access to Whitehall Publisher](LINK).

### If you’re creating a new statistical data set

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select the ‘Statistical data set’ option, and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Add the title, summary and body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
5. Select ‘Limit access’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from tagged organisations can see it before it’s published and it will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
6. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can add the data set as an attachment.

### If you’re updating an existing statistical data set 

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the statistical data set you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’, or select ‘Delete draft’ if you want to start a new draft.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only be important if your organisation is asked to take part in a history mode audit.
7. Decide whether you need to [write change notes](LINK). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
8. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the attachments.

> If you select ‘Create new edition’ and you get a message telling you that the ‘document is in history mode’, you cannot update it without help from the Government Digital Service (GDS). See the [guidance on removing history mode](LINK) for more details.

## Add or edit attachments

Make sure you correctly [format attachments](LINK) before you upload them. You can upload attachments one at a time or as a bulk upload.

Select the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the page. You can add, edit or delete attachments from here.

If you’re editing multiple attachments, the bulk uploader can be used to quickly overwrite previous versions. If you’re doing this, make sure your new files have the same file names as your old ones.

You cannot add HTML attachments to this content type.

### If you’re adding new attachments

When you add attachments:

- use the official title of the document
- do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’, so users can see information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format like audio or Braille

For each attachment, you get two codes that you can add to the body. You can either add the attachment as:


- an ‘inline’ link
- a ‘publication box’ that you can embed – this will let users see the information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format

Read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for more information about the different types of attachment.

## Change the ‘first published’ date

You can change the first published date if the same statistical data set was available on another webpage before.

Under ‘First published date’, tick the ‘This document has previously been published on another website’ box. Select the new date.

The new date will show when you publish the draft.

## Add or remove tags to organisations

Under the body, you can tag your statistical data set to lead and supporting organisations. You do this by adding or removing associations.

Your own organisation will be set as a lead organisation as default, but you can change that or add any other organisations if they’re responsible for the statistical data set.

## Update settings of the draft

You have the option of:

- changing the ‘Email address for ordering attachment files in an accessible format’
- selecting ‘Schedule publication’, if you want the draft published on a certain date – you’ll still need to get someone to approve the draft or force schedule it yourself
- selecting ‘Review date’, if you want to get an email asking you to check the content at a later date after you’ve published it

## Add or remove topic tags

You need to tag your statistical data set to at least one topic page before you can publish it.

Your statistical data set will appear on the tagged topic pages automatically when it’s published. [See an example of a topic page](https://www.gov.uk/education).

To add tags:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Topic taxonomy tags’ heading, select ‘Add tags’ or ‘Change tags’.
3. Select the boxes next to each topic that applies. The arrows next to each topic will expand the topic out, showing all sub-topics in that topic ‘tree’.

To remove tags, select ‘Remove topic’ next to the one you want to remove.

Choose topic tags:

- based only on what the content is about
- from anywhere in the topic ‘tree’, not just the areas that your organisation uses the most

Try to choose the most low-level topics you can.

You can tag your content to as many topic pages as are relevant. There’s no limit.

## No translations available

You cannot add translations of statistical data sets.

## Update the URL

URLs are automatically created from the page title when you first publish the content. You might want to update the URL if there’s a typo or if it no longer reflects the content.

If you have not published the first draft, you can update the draft title and the URL will change.

If you’ve already published a draft, you can:

1. Create a new statistical data set with the desired title and URL.
2. Copy over the content from the current statistical data set to this new draft.
3. Publish the new draft.
4. [Unpublish the page](LINK) with the incorrect URL and set up a redirect to the new page.

The change notes history will be lost if you do this. If you need to keep that, [contact the Government Digital Service (GDS)](LINK) and ask them to change the URL instead.

## Publish the draft

Find out how to [send the draft for review](LINK).

If you need to publish it urgently without a review, find out when you can [publish your own draft](LINK).
