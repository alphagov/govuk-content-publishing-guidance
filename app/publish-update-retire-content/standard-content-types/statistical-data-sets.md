## When to use this content type

Use statistical data sets for data that you both:

- publish monthly or more often
- publish without analysis, like raw data

For data sets you publish less frequently or with analysis, use [statistics content](LINK) instead.

## Create a draft

{% include "reusable-content/signon-account-whitehall.md" %}

### If you’re creating a new statistical data set

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select ‘Statistical data set’ and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Add the title, summary and body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
5. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
6. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can add the data set as an attachment.

### If you’re updating an existing statistical data set 

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the statistical data set you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
7. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
8. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
9. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the attachments.

{% include "reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md" %}

## Add or edit attachments

{% include "reusable-content/add-attachments-markdown-1.md" %}

### If you’re adding new attachments

{% include "reusable-content/add-attachments-markdown-2.md" %}

## Change the ‘first published date’

{% include "reusable-content/change-first-published.md" %}

## Add or remove tags to organisations

You can tag your content under the ‘Associations’ heading. You do this by adding or removing associations to lead and supporting organisations.

Your own organisation will be set as a lead organisation as default, but you can change that or add any other organisations if they’re responsible for the statistical data set.
