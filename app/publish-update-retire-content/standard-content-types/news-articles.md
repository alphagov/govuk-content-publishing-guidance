## Choose the right type of news article

There are different types of news article. Make sure you choose the right type.

| Content type | What to use it for | What not to use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Government response** | Government statements produced in response to media coverage by the organisation’s press team. For example, rebuttals or ‘myth busters’. <br><br> These are usually short and to the point, consisting of a quotation with no headings. | Statements issued to Parliament. Speeches or press articles. Letters to newspapers written by ministers. <br><br> Use the [speech type](LINK) for all of these instead. |
| **News story** | Genuine news content written exclusively for GOV.UK which users need, can act on, would expect to get directly from the government and cannot get from other sources. <br><br> For example, the opening of a government grant scheme or a change to public services that affects public sector employees. <br><br> The content should be self-contained. It should be possible to delete it from the site without affecting anything else. <br><br> You can also use this to set out details about future events that your organisation is holding. Use a [document collection](LINK) to collect multiple news stories if you’re holding a programme of events. | Information about putting your organisation’s views on record. Use the government response type instead. <br><br> Duplication of press releases or [fatality notices](LINK). <br><br> Duplication of another organisation’s news story. Consider publishing a news story jointly, or cover the same story from different angles or for different audiences. <br><br> Promotion of the publication of other content, like statistics. <br><br> General purpose content pages or just to link through to other GOV.UK content. <br><br> Guidance for users. Link to a [guidance publication](LINK) or [detailed guide](LINK) if there’s something a user can act on. |
| **Press release** | Unedited press releases as sent to the media. You can put additional notes at the end under a ‘Background’ heading. <br><br> Official statements by an organisation spokesperson. <br><br> Official statements made by a minister, apart from parliamentary statements. | Ministerial statements issued to Parliament. Use the [speech type](LINK) instead. <br><br> Promotion of the publication of other content, like statistics. <br><br> Guidance for users. Link to a [guidance publication](LINK) or [detailed guide](LINK) if there’s something a user can act on. |
| **World news story** | Announcements specific to one or more world location. For example, news related to a British embassy. | Duplication of another organisation’s news story. |

## Create a draft

To work on a news article, you’ll need a [Signon account with access to Whitehall Publisher](LINK).

### If you’re creating a new article

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select the ‘News article’ option, and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Select the content type from the dropdown under ‘News article type (required)’.
5. Add the title, summary and body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Select ‘Limit access’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from tagged organisations can see it before it’s published and it will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
7. If you’re creating a world news story, tag the story to a world location and worldwide organisation under the ‘Associations’ heading.
7. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can add images and attachments.

### If you’re updating an existing article

Do not make updates unless you’re correcting an error. News articles are supposed to reflect the government’s position at a particular moment in time.

If a news article is outdated, consider [withdrawing or unpublishing the existing content](LINK) and publishing a new article.

If you’re correcting an error:

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the news article you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’, or select ‘Delete draft’ if you want to start a new draft.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only be important if your organisation is asked to take part in a history mode audit.
7. Decide whether you need to [write change notes](LINK). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
8. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the images and attachments.

> If you select ‘Create new edition’ and you get a message telling you that the ‘document is in history mode’, you cannot update it without help from the Government Digital Service (GDS). See the [guidance on removing history mode](LINK) for more details.

## Add or remove images

Make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the images](LINK) before you add them.

Select the ‘Images’ tab at the top of the page. You can upload images here. Each image will need a unique file name.

One of the images you upload will be the lead image, unless it’s a scalable vector graphic (SVG) file. The lead image appears in the top-left corner. You cannot use the lead image again in the body.

The first non-SVG image you upload will automatically be the lead image. If you want to change the lead image, upload another non-SVG image and select ‘Select as lead image’.

For images other than the lead image, you’ll be given a ‘Markdown code’ that you can copy and paste into the body.

If you want to remove an image, you can remove its code from the body. You can then upload a new version of the image and use its code instead.

### If you do not add any non-SVG images

The default image for the lead organisation will be used as the lead image, if there is one.

You can add or change the default image on the relevant [organisation page](LINK).

## Add or edit attachments

Make sure you correctly [format attachments](LINK) before you upload them. You can upload attachments one at a time or as a bulk upload.

Select the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the page. You can add, edit or delete attachments from here.

If you’re editing multiple attachments, the bulk uploader can be used to quickly overwrite previous versions. If you’re doing this, make sure your new files have the same file names as your old ones.

You cannot add HTML attachments to this content type.

### If you’re adding new attachments

When you add attachments:

- use the official title of the document
- do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’, so users can see information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format like audio or Braille

For each attachment, you get two codes that you can add to the body. You can either add the attachment as:


- an ‘inline’ link
- a ‘publication box’ that you can embed – this will let users see the information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format

Read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for more information about the different types of attachment.

## Add or remove contact details

You can add contact details using your organisation’s contact directory. That means if the details in the directory are updated, they’ll automatically update in your content too.

All frequently used email addresses should be in the contact directory. Find out how to [create or update contacts](LINK).

To add a contact from a directory:

1. Go to ‘More’ at the top of Whitehall Publisher.
2. Select ‘Organisations’ and find the organisation that owns the contact. Select ‘View’ next to their name.
3. Go to the ‘Contacts’ tab and copy the relevant ‘Markdown code’.
4. Paste the code into your document.

You can remove the contact details by deleting the code.

If you do not want to use the contact directory, use the [formatting guidance](LINK) to add contact details.

## Change the ‘first published’ date

You can change the first published date if the same news article was available on another webpage before.

Under ‘First published date’, tick the ‘This document has previously been published on another website’ box. Select the new date.

The new date will show when you publish the draft.

## Add or remove tags to organisations, people and events

Under the body, you can tag your news article. You do this by adding or removing associations.

These associations include:

- ministers – use this if a government minister has had direct involvement with the content, like if it’s written by a minister or it’s a press release about a ministerial visit
- topical events – use this if you want the news article to appear on a [topical event page](LINK)
- world locations – use this if you work for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and you want the news article to appear on a [world location news](LINK)
- lead and supporting organisations – your own organisation will be set as a lead organisation as default, but you can change that or add any other organisations if they’re responsible for the news article

> If you’re creating a world news story, you cannot tag it to a minister or a lead or supporting organisation, but you must tag it to a worldwide organisation.

## Update settings of the draft

You have the option of:

- changing the ‘Email address for ordering attachment files in an accessible format’
- selecting ‘Schedule publication’, if you want the draft published on a certain date – you’ll still need to get someone to approve the draft or force schedule it yourself
- selecting ‘Review date’, if you want to get an email asking you to check the content at a later date after you’ve published it

## Add or remove topic tags

You need to tag your news article to at least one topic page before you can publish it.

Your news article will appear on the tagged topic pages automatically when it’s published. [See an example of a topic page](https://www.gov.uk/education).

To add tags:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Topic taxonomy tags’ heading, select ‘Add tags’ or ‘Change tags’.
3. Select the boxes next to each topic that applies. The arrows next to each topic will expand the topic out, showing all sub-topics in that topic ‘tree’.

To remove tags, select ‘Remove topic’ next to the one you want to remove.

Choose topic tags:

- based only on what the content is about
- from anywhere in the topic ‘tree’, not just the areas that your organisation uses the most

Try to choose the most low-level topics you can.

You can tag your content to as many topic pages as are relevant. There’s no limit.

## Add or edit translations

If you’re working on a world news story that will only be published in a language other than English, tick the ‘Create a foreign language only document collection’ and select the language.

Otherwise, you need to have an English version and then a translation.

### Add a new translation

Read the [guidance about deciding whether to add a translation](LINK).

If you do want to add a translation:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft. 
2. Under the ‘Translations’ heading, select ‘Add translation’.
3. Add the translated title, summary and body.
4. Select ‘Save’.
5. If you want to add any translated attachments, go back to the English version and add the attachments there. You can then copy the code and paste it into the translated version.  
6. Check the translations are working by selecting ‘Preview translated pages’ under the ‘Preview’ heading.

> If you’re adding a translation for a language that is written from right to left, there’s a different way to [format links](LINK).

### Edit an existing translation

If you want to update the title, summary or body of a translation:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft. 
2. Under the ‘Translations’ heading, select ‘Edit’ next to the relevant translation.
3. Make the changes and select ‘Save’.

If you want to update an attachment:

1. Go to the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the draft of the English version.
2. Select ‘Edit attachment’ under the relevant attachment.

## Update the URL

URLs are automatically created from the page title when you first publish the content. You might want to update the URL if there’s a typo or if it no longer reflects the content.

If you have not published the first draft, you can update the draft title and the URL will change.

If you’ve already published a draft, you can:

1. Create a new article with the desired title and URL.
2. Copy over the content from the current news article to this new draft.
3. Publish the new draft.
4. [Unpublish the page](LINK) with the incorrect URL and set up a redirect to the new page.

The change notes history will be lost if you do this. If you need to keep that, [contact GDS](LINK) and ask them to change the URL instead.

## Publish the draft

Find out how to [send the draft for review](LINK).

If you need to publish it urgently without a review, find out when you can [publish your own draft](LINK).
