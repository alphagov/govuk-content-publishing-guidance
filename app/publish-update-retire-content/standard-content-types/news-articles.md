## Choose the right type of news article

There are different types of news articles. Make sure you choose the right type.

## Create a draft

{% include 'reusable-content/signon-account-whitehall.md' %}

### If you're creating a new article

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the 'New document' tab.
3. Select 'News article' and then select the 'Next' button.
4. Choose the type of news article from the following page and select ‘Next’.
5. Add the title, summary and body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](/formatting-content/) for help.
6. Select 'Limit access' under 'Settings' if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it's published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](https://signon.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/).
7. If you're creating a world news story, tag the story to a world location and worldwide organisation under the 'Associations' heading.
7. Select the 'Save' button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can add images and attachments.

### If you're updating an existing article

Do not make updates unless you're correcting an error. News articles are supposed to reflect the government's position at a particular moment in time.

If a news article is outdated, consider [withdrawing or unpublishing the existing content](/publish-update-retire-content/standard-content-types/withdraw-unpublish-standard/) and publishing a new article.

If you're correcting an error:

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the 'Documents' tab.
3. Search for the news article you want to edit, and select the 'View' link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select 'Change tags' under 'Topic taxonomy tags'. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the 'Create new edition' button. If a new edition has already been created, select the 'Go to draft' link. You can then select 'Edit draft' or, if you do not want to use this draft, select 'Delete draft' and then select 'Create new edition'.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](/formatting-content/) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
7. Select 'Limit access' under 'Settings' if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it's published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](https://signon.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/).
8. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under 'Do users have to know the content has changed?', and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
9. Select the 'Save' button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the images and attachments.

{% include 'reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md' %}

## Add or remove images

Make sure you've correctly [formatted the images](/formatting-content/images-videos/formatting-images/) before you add them.

Select the 'Images' tab at the top of the page. You can upload images here. Each image will need a different file name.

### Lead image

News articles must have a lead image. The lead image appears above the body content.

If you do not select a lead image, a default image will be used. You can add or change your organisation’s default image by updating your [organisation page](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/organisations/).

If you want to use a custom lead image, upload it. Under ‘Custom lead image’, select its file name and then select ‘Save’. You cannot use an SVG file as a lead image. You cannot use the lead image again in the body.

### Other images

You’ll be given a ‘Markdown code’ when you upload the image. You can copy and paste that into the body and the image will appear there.

If you want to remove an image, you can remove its code from the body. You can then upload a new version of the image and use its code instead.

## Add or edit attachments

{% include 'reusable-content/add-attachments-markdown-1.md' %}

### If you're adding new attachments

{% include 'reusable-content/add-attachments-markdown-2.md' %}

## Add or remove contact details

{% include 'reusable-content/add-contacts.md' %}

## Change the 'first published date'

{% include 'reusable-content/change-first-published.md' %}

## Add or remove tags to organisations, people and events

{% include 'reusable-content/associations-introduction.md' %} 

{% include 'reusable-content/associations-ministers.md' %}

{% include 'reusable-content/associations-world.md' %}

{% include 'reusable-content/associations-topical.md' %}

{% include 'reusable-content/associations-organisations.md' %}

> [!NOTE]
> If you're creating a world news story, you cannot tag it to a minister or a lead or supporting organisation, but you must tag it to a worldwide organisation.

You can then add translations in languages other than English following the steps under 'Add a new translation'.

You cannot change the primary language if you’ve added translations to the page.
