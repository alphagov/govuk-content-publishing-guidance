While different content types have different purposes, some content types on GOV.UK have similar processes for how you'll add, update or retire them. These 'standard' types are:

- Calls for evidence
- Case studies
- Consultation
- Document collections
- Fatality notices
- Detailed guides
- News articles
- Publications
- Speeches
- Statistical data sets
- Statistics 
- Worldwide pages

This section of guidance covers these content types, as well as the common processes for:

- reviewing content that's been sent for '2nd eyes'
- publishing content
- 'retiring' - either withdrawing or unpublishing - content
