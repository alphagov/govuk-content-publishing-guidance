Anyone with ‘editor’ permissions on Whitehall Publisher can publish content.

If you want ‘editor’ permissions to do this, ask an [organisation admin](LINK) on your team to grant you these permissions.

## Publish someone else’s draft

If you’re happy for a draft to go live, you can select either:

- ‘Publish’, if you’re happy for it to be published now
- ‘Schedule’, if a scheduled publication date has been added – you can unschedule it later if the publication date changes or you want to make changes to the draft

The person who created the draft will get an email either way.

## Publish your own draft urgently without a review

In rare circumstances you may need to ‘force publish’ a document. For example, if a document needs to be published urgently and there is no editor available to review it.

Select ‘Force publish’ or ‘Force schedule’. You’ll need to give a reason why you needed to force publish without a review.

Content that has been force published or force scheduled is flagged as ‘not reviewed’. It should be reviewed as soon as possible after publication. 

When an editor has reviewed the published content, they can select ‘Approve’ on the edition summary page.

## Understand how long publication takes

If you’re publishing something without scheduling:

- new content will go live straight away
- updates to existing content will take up to 5 minutes to go live

If you’re scheduling, it will go live at the requested time. However, it must be approved at least 30 minutes beforehand.

If a page does not seem to have been updated, it may be because you’re looking at a cached version. The time this takes to update is controlled by your IT team.

You can check if a page has updated by:

- using a smartphone or non-work computer to access the page, instead of your work computer
- doing a ‘cache-bust’ by putting a question mark and some random text after the page URL you’re looking at – for example www.gov.uk/government/organisations?THISISRANDOMTEXT

Never share or publicise cache-busted URLs.

Do not use or publicise the URL for a page before it’s been published. It will cause a ‘page not found (404)’ message to be displayed.

## Email notifications

Once the draft has been published, users might get an email notification about it unless you’re publishing a ‘minor’ update without change notes.

To get an email notification, users would need to be subscribed to updates from one of the tagged:

- organisations
- ministers
- topical events 
- worldwide locations
- topic pages

They may also be subscribed to all government content published in a certain format, like ‘Guidance and regulations’.

If you’re publishing a major update, they could also be subscribed to the content itself if it’s a:

- consultation
- detailed guide
- document collection
- publication

Users can choose how often they want to receive email alerts – ‘immediately’, ‘daily’ or ‘weekly’. That means users will not all be notified at the same time.
