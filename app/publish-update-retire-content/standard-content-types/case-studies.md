## When to use this content type

Use case studies for real examples that help users understand someone’s personal experience with either:

- a task that’s covered on GOV.UK (for example, it shows someone’s experience of taking part in a particular government programme)
- an important aspect of government policy that’s covered on GOV.UK (for example, it shows someone’s experience of a policy problem the government is trying to solve)

They can be either a first person account or a third person account with quotes from the person it’s about. They can be in video form.

> [!NOTE]
> See a [good example of a case study on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/case-studies/how-the-home-offices-immigration-technology-department-reduced-its-cloud-costs-by-40).

Do not create a case study if:

- it’s just about promoting your organisation – this makes it harder for users to find the practical information they need
- it does not relate directly to guidance or policy content on GOV.UK, or add something really important to it
- it’s only going to be useful for a short time – if so, it will be better dealt with in a [news article](LINK)
- it’s similar to an existing case study – this can confuse users

Remember, most users just want practical guidance. Case studies can make it harder to find that guidance, as they can take up space in search results and give users something else to read. It’s often best to concentrate on getting the wording of the guidance right instead.

## Create a draft

{% include 'reusable-content/signon-account-whitehall.md' %}

### If you’re creating a new case study

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select ‘Case study’ and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Add the title. It should summarise the point of the case study, like ‘UK money helps to build homes in Darfur’.
5. Add the summary. It should outline what happened, why it happened and the result.
6. Add the body. Include information about how the case study supports a particular policy (with links to relevant pages). If you can, include statistics and facts about things like how many people will be helped and how much money is being spent. Finally, include the human element of who is benefiting and how. Avoid too much detail about the past or too many quotations (unless it’s an interview).
5. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
6. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

{% include 'reusable-content/style-formatting-extra.md' %}


After saving the page, you can add images and attachments.

### If you’re updating an existing case study 

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the case study you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
7. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
8. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
9. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the images and attachments.

{% include 'reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md' %} 

## Add or remove images

{% include ‘reusable-content/add-images-without-html-attachments.md’ %}

### Select a lead image

The lead image appears above the body content, and cannot be used again in the body. 

Your organisation's default lead image will be used unless either:

- you upload another image and make that the lead image
- you remove the lead image from the content

If you upload another image, use the ‘Select as lead image’ button to make it the new lead image. You cannot do this with a SVG file.

If you want to remove the lead image completely, select ‘Remove lead image’.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also update your organisation’s default lead image. Read the [guidance on updating organisation pages](LINK) for instructions.

## Change the ‘first published date’
