## When to use

Use a document collection for grouping related content on a single page:

- for a specific audience
- around a specific theme or topic

A collection could be used to publish:

- a set of forms
- publications in the same series
- a mix of document types related to the same task or event

You can add a document to more than one collection.

Do not create a collection:

- for documents that users do not need, or would not expect, to find together
- in place of a records management system
- for a single piece of content
- for editions of the same publication (these should be multiple attachments on a single publication page)

## Create a draft

To work on a document collection, you’ll need a [Signon account with access to Whitehall Publisher](LINK).

### If you’re creating a new document collection

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select the ‘Document collection’ option, and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. If the document collection is in a language other than English, tick the ‘Create a foreign language only document collection’ and select the language.
5. Add the title and summary. You can add a further description of the collection to the body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Select ‘Limit access’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from tagged organisations can see it before it’s published and it will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
7. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can start adding the collection itself.

### If you’re updating an existing document collection

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the document collection you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’, or select ‘Delete draft’ if you want to start a new draft.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary and body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only be important if your organisation is asked to take part in a history mode audit.
7. Decide whether you need to [write change notes](LINK). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
8. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can start editing the collection itself.

> If you select ‘Create new edition’ and you get a message telling you that the ‘document is in history mode’, you cannot update it without help from the Government Digital Service (GDS). See the [guidance on removing history mode](LINK) for more details.

## Add or edit the content items in a collection

Go to the ‘Collections’ tab.

You organise content by listing them under different headings, or ‘groups’.

You can change the default group names to something more descriptive of the content you’re linking to, for example ‘Annual reports 2015 to 2020’.

You can also use the description for each group to add a one-line introduction under the heading. For example, ‘These reports give an account of activity and services for each year, including financial statements.’

### Add or edit a group

To add a new group:

1. Select ‘Add group’.
2. Enter the name of the new group in the ‘Name’ field.
3. You can choose whether to add a description of the group in the ‘Description’ field. 
4. Select ‘Save’.

To reorder groups:

1. Select ‘Reorder group’. 
2. To move one place, select the ‘Up’ or ‘Down’ button. To move multiple places, select the button and drag it to its new position. 
3. Select ‘Save’.

To edit the name or description of a group:

1. Select ‘View’. 
2. Select the ‘Group details’ tab.
3. Select the ‘Edit’ link. 
4. Update the name and description.
5. Select ‘Save’.

### Add or edit content within a group

To add content to a group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Add document’.
3. You can then either select ‘By URL’ and enter the full URL of the page or select ‘By title’ and search for the full or partial title of the page.

To remove content from a group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Remove’ next to the content you want to remove.
3. Select ‘Remove’ again.

To reorder content in the group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Reorder document’.
3. Use the ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ buttons to reorder one place or select and drag the button to move it up or down multiple places. 
4. Select ‘Save’.

> Select ‘Back’ when you’re ready to stop editing the content within a group.

## No attachments available

You cannot add attachments to this content type. If you want to include a link to a file, think about whether you can upload it as a separate piece of content.

## No images available

You cannot add images to this content type.

## Change the ‘first published’ date

You can change the first published date if the same document collection was available on another webpage before.

Under ‘First published date’, tick the ‘This document has previously been published on another website’ box. Select the new date.

The new date will show when you publish the draft.

## Add or remove tags to organisations and events

Under the body, you can tag your document collection. You do this by adding or removing associations.

These associations include:

- topical events – use this if you want the document collection to appear on a [topical event page](LINK)
- lead and supporting organisations – your own organisation will be set as a lead organisation as default, but you can change that or add any other organisations if they’re responsible for the document collection

## Update settings of the draft

You have the option of:

- selecting ‘Schedule publication’, if you want the draft published on a certain date – you’ll still need to get someone to approve the draft or force schedule it yourself
- selecting ‘Review date’, if you want to get an email asking you to check the content at a later date after you’ve published it

## Add or remove topic tags

You need to tag your document collection to at least one topic page before you can publish it.

Your document collection will appear on the tagged topic pages automatically when it’s published. [See an example of a topic page](https://www.gov.uk/education).

To add tags:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Topic taxonomy tags’ heading, select ‘Add tags’ or ‘Change tags’.
3. Select the boxes next to each topic that applies. The arrows next to each topic will expand the topic out, showing all sub-topics in that topic ‘tree’.

To remove tags, select ‘Remove topic’ next to the one you want to remove.

Choose topic tags:

- based only on what the content is about
- from anywhere in the topic ‘tree’, not just the areas that your organisation uses the most

Try to choose the most low-level topics you can.

You can tag your content to as many topic pages as are relevant. There’s no limit.

## Add or edit translations

### Add a new translation

Read the [guidance about deciding whether to add a translation](LINK).

If you want to add a translation, you’ll need to create a completely separate draft and select ‘Create a foreign language only document collection’.

It will exist as a completely separate piece of content to the English version.

Add the link to the foreign language version as a call to action at the top of the English version, using this format: “[View this document collection in Arabic](link)".

Repeat the steps to link the English version to the foreign language version. If you have multiple translations, make sure all the translations are linked.

### Edit an existing translation

Search for the translated version on Whitehall Publisher and create a new draft. It will exist as a completely separate piece of content to the English version.

## Update the URL

URLs are automatically created from the page title when you first publish the content. You might want to update the URL if there’s a typo or if it no longer reflects the content.

If you have not published the first draft, you can update the draft title and the URL will change.

If you’ve already published a draft, you can:

1. Create a new document collection with the desired title and URL.
2. Copy over the content from the current document collection to this new draft.
3. Publish the new draft.
4. [Unpublish the page](LINK) with the incorrect URL and set up a redirect to the new page.

The change notes history will be lost if you do this. If you need to keep that, [contact GDS](LINK) and ask them to change the URL instead.

## Publish the draft

Find out how to [send the draft for review](LINK).

If you need to publish it urgently without a review, find out when you can [publish your own draft](LINK).
