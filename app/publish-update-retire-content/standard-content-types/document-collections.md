## When to use this content type

Use a document collection for grouping GOV.UK content on a single page:

- for a specific audience
- around a specific theme or topic

A collection could be used to publish:

- a set of forms
- publications in the same series
- different content types related to the same task or event

You can add content to more than one collection.

Do not create a collection:

- for content that users do not need, or would not expect, to find together
- in place of a records management system
- for a single piece of content
- for editions of the same publication (these should be multiple attachments on a single publication page)

## Create a draft

{% include "reusable-content/signon-account-whitehall.md" %}

### If you’re creating a new document collection

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select ‘Document collection’ and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. If the document collection is not in English, tick ‘Create a foreign language only document collection’ and select the language.
5. Add the title and summary. You can add a further description of the collection to the body. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
7. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can start adding the collection itself.

### If you’re updating an existing document collection

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the document collection you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link. You can then select ‘Edit draft’ or, if you do not want to use this draft, select ‘Delete draft’ and then select ‘Create new edition’.
5. Make any changes to the title, summary and body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
6. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only need to be changed if your organisation is asked to take part in an audit of content before a general election.
7. Select ‘Limit access’ under ‘Settings’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from organisations tagged to the content can see it before it’s published. It will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
8. Decide whether you need to [write public change notes](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/change-notes/). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
9. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

After saving the page, you can start editing the collection itself.

{% include "reusable-content/remove-history-mode.md" %}

## Add or edit the content items in a collection

After you’ve created a draft, go to the ‘Collections’ tab.

You organise content by listing them under different headings, or ‘groups’.

You can change the default group names to something that better describes the content you’re linking to, for example ‘Annual reports 2015 to 2020’.

You can also add a one line description for each group. This will appear under the heading. For example: ‘These reports give an account of activity and services for each year, including financial statements.’

### Add or edit a group

To add a new group:

1. Select ‘Add group’.
2. Enter the name of the new group in the ‘Name’ field.
3. You can choose whether to add a description of the group in the ‘Description’ field. 
4. Select ‘Save’.
5. You’ll need to add content to the group for it to show on the page.

To reorder groups:

1. Select ‘Reorder group’. 
2. Select the ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ buttons or drag and drop the groups.
3. Select ‘Save’.

To edit the name or description of a group:

1. Select ‘View’. 
2. Select the ‘Group details’ tab.
3. Select the ‘Edit’ link. 
4. Update the name and description.
5. Select ‘Save’.

### Add or edit content within a group

To add content to a group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Add document’.
3. You can then either select ‘By URL’ and enter the full URL of the page or select ‘By title’ and search for the full or partial title of the page.

To remove content from a group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Remove’ next to the content you want to remove.
3. Select ‘Remove’ again.

To reorder content in the group:

1. Select ‘View’ next to the relevant group. 
2. Select ‘Reorder document’.
3. Select the ‘Up’ and ‘Down’ buttons or drag and drop the groups.
4. Select ‘Save’.

> [!NOTE]
> Select ‘Back’ when you’re ready to stop editing the content within a group.
