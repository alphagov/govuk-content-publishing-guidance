## Before review

Check how your draft will look on GOV.UK before sending it for review. Select ‘Preview on website (opens in new tab)’ under the body field or on the edition summary page.

Then add a note so other editors can see who requested the change and why. On the edition summary page:

1. Under the ‘History’ tab, select ‘Add internal note’.
2. Add the explanation and select ‘Submit internal note’.

These notes will only be seen by users with access to Whitehall Publisher.

## Send the draft for review

Select ‘Submit for 2nd eyes’ on the edition summary page.

You can then share a link to the draft with someone on your team with ‘editor’ permissions. The system does not automatically notify anyone. You can send that reviewer the [guidance on reviewing drafts](LINK).

The reviewer can then decide whether to publish your draft. You’ll get an email if they publish or reject it.

Rejected content goes back to draft status. After further editing, you can submit it for review again.

## Share the draft with someone without Whitehall Publisher access

If you want them to just look at the draft:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Preview’ heading, select the ‘Share document preview’ dropdown. You’ll get a link you can send which will work for 30 days. The link will only work for the page you’re previewing.
3. If the link expires or you send it to the wrong person, select ‘Generate a new link’. This will disable the previous preview link.

If you want them to fact check the content and potentially add comments:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Select the ‘Fact checking’ tab on the box on the right hand side.
3. Add the email address of the person who will be fact checking. If multiple people will be fact checking, send a separate request to each one.
4. In the extra instructions, add the generic GOV.UK username and password so they can see the preview.
5. The person will get a preview link sent to them by email. They can add comments, and you’ll get an email when they’ve sent a response.
