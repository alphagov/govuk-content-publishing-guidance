## When to use

Use publications for:

- publishing standalone government documents – they are date-stamped and usually not updated once published
- white papers, strategy documents and reports

Do not create a publication for:

- meeting minutes, agendas or other meeting papers – these should be attached directly to a [group page](LINK) or [governance corporate information page](LINK) 
- videos – these should be embedded directly in the content they relate to

Publication pages should not include multiple documents, unless they are:

- versions of the same document, such as a PDF and a HTML attachment or an interim report and a final report
- chapters of one document
- forms and guidance about filling in those forms
- policy papers and impact assessments of those policies

Otherwise, publish the documents separately and use a [document collection](LINK) to group them together.

> To work on a publication, you’ll need a [Signon account with access to Whitehall Publisher](LINK).

## Choose the right type of publication

There are different types of publications. Make sure you choose the right type, because:

- if your content is in the wrong content type, users will not be able to find it
- the content type can affect how and where the content appears in search and navigation
- it could wrongly go into [history mode](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/)

| Content type | What to use it for | What not to use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Corporate report** | Publications about your organisation as a corporate entity. This includes accounts, annual reports, business plans, performance and efficiency reviews and structural reform plans. | Publications about what your organisation does, like strategy documents. Use the policy paper type instead. |
| **Correspondence** | Correspondence created by your organisation or ministers. This includes announcements, letters, responses and statements. It also includes bulletins, circulars, e-bulletins and newsletters. | Formal decision letters from tribunals, regulators or adjudicators. Use the decision type instead. |

Use the [consultation type](LINK) or [call for evidence type](LINK) instead. Press announcements about the decision. Use the [news article type](LINK) instead. |

| **Freedom of Information (FOI) release** | Responses to FOI requests. | Anything that is not a response to an FOI request. |
| **Guidance** | Non-statutory guidance publications like handbooks or other documents that offer advice. Guidance material that has been produced as a standalone hard-copy publication. | Statutory guidance. Use the statutory guidance type instead. Guidance about completing a form. Attach it to the same publication as the form itself. |
| **Impact assessment** | Documents that assess the impact of new initiatives or changes to legislation. This includes impact assessments, equality impact assessments and equality impact analyses. | Impact assessments related to policy papers already published on GOV.UK. Attach it to the same publication as the policy paper. |
| **Independent report** | Reports commissioned by the government but written by non-government organisations. This includes independent enquiries, investigations and reviews. | Reports written by the government. Use the policy paper type or research and analysis type instead. |
| **International treaty** | Treaties and memoranda of understanding between the UK and other nations. | Anything that is not an international treaty or memoranda of understanding. |
| **Map** | Drawn maps and geographical data. | Anything that is not a map or geographical data. |
| **Notice** | Permit and licence applications that have to be published temporarily in a public space so users can view, comment or lodge an objection. | Anything that is not a permit or licence application. |

The page can also include any related impact assessments. | Publications that include instructions about how to carry out a task. Use the guidance type instead. |

## Create a draft

### If you’re creating a new publication

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘New document’ tab.
3. Select the ‘Publication’ option, and then select the ‘Next’ button.
4. Select the content type from the dropdown under ‘Publication type (required)’.
5. Add the title and summary. Add a description of the publication to the body.
6. Select the relevant options under ‘Excluded nations (required)’.
7. Select ‘Limit access’ if your draft is sensitive. This means only users from tagged organisations can see it before it’s published and it will not be copied across to [Integration](LINK).
8. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help with writing the title, summary and body.

After saving the page, you can add attachments and images.

> If you’re publishing transparency data, check if there’s relevant [‘How to publish’ guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-publish-central-government-transparency-data) with template titles, summaries and bodies that you must use.

### If you’re updating an existing publication

1. Go to [Whitehall Publisher](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/).
2. Select the ‘Documents’ tab.
3. Search for the publication you want to edit, and select the ‘View’ link next to it. This will take you to the edition summary page. If you only want to update the topic tags and nothing else, select ‘Change tags’ under ‘Topic taxonomy tags’. Otherwise, keep following these steps.
4. Select the ‘Create new edition’ button. If a new edition has already been created, select the ‘Go to draft’ link instead. You can then select ‘Edit draft’, or select ‘Delete draft’ if you want to start a new draft.
5. Do not change anything under the 'Political' heading. This is related to [history mode](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) and it will only be important if your organisation is asked to take part in a history mode audit.
6. Make any changes to the title, summary or body as needed. Read the [tone of voice guidance](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/) and [formatting guidance](LINK) for help.
7. Change the options under ‘Excluded nations (required)’ if needed.
8. Decide whether you need to [write change notes](LINK). Go to the bottom of the page and select the relevant option under ‘Do users have to know the content has changed?’, and add your change notes if needed (you can edit them again before you publish the draft).
9. Select the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the page.

You can now edit the attachments and images.

> If you select ‘Create new edition’ and you get a message telling you that the ‘document is in history mode’, you cannot update it without help from the Government Digital Service (GDS). See the [guidance on removing history mode](LINK) for more details.

## Add or edit attachments

The publication itself should be added as an attachment.

Make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the attachment](LINK) before you upload it.

Select the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the page. You can add, edit or delete attachments from here, and change the order they appear on the page.

Your attachments can either be:

- file attachments (uploaded either one at a time or as a bulk upload)
- HTML attachments
- external attachments, if the publication is not on GOV.UK

If you’re editing multiple file attachments, the bulk uploader can be used to quickly overwrite previous versions. If you’re doing this, make sure your new files have the same file names as your old ones.

When you add attachments:

- use the official title of the publication
- for file attachments, do not tick ‘Attachment is accessible’ – this will let users see a box with information about requesting the attachment in an accessible format, like audio or Braille

### Fill in more fields if you’re attaching official documents

There are extra fields you need to fill in if your publication is an ‘official document’. These are publications that are ‘laid before’ (presented to) Parliament, like certain annual reports and accounts.

If they’re added correctly, they will show up on the [official documents search tool](https://www.gov.uk/official-documents).

The National Archives explains the [different types of official documents](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/producing-official-publications/parliamentary-papers-guidance/types-parliamentary-paper/), which they call ‘parliamentary papers’.

For any official document uploaded as a PDF, add ‘(print-ready PDF)’ at the end of the title.

If it’s a command paper, fill in these fields:

- ISBN
- Unique reference – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- Command paper number – use the number found on the title page of the document (if there’s no number, tick the box labelled ‘Unnumbered’)

If it’s a House of Commons paper, fill in these fields:

- ISBN
- Unique reference – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- House of Commons paper number – use the number found on the title page of the document, but do not include ‘HC’ as this will be added automatically
- Parliamentary session – if you’re not sure which session it is, you can [check the Parliamentary session calendar on the UK Parliament website](https://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/recess-dates/)

If it’s an unnumbered act paper, fill in these fields:

- ISBN
- Unique reference – the departmental unique reference number (URN), if the document has been given one
- House of Commons paper number – leave the field blank and tick the box labelled ‘Unnumbered act paper’

## Add or remove images

Make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the images](LINK) before you add them.

Select the ‘Images’ tab at the top of the page. You can upload images here. Each image will need a unique file name.

Once you upload an image, you’ll be given a ‘Markdown code’ that you can copy and paste into the body or HTML attachments.

If you want to remove an image, you can remove its code from the body or HTML attachments. You can then upload a new version of the image and use its code instead.

## Add or remove contact details

You can add contact details using your organisation’s contact directory. That means if the details in the directory are updated, they’ll automatically update in your content too.

All frequently used email addresses should be in the contact directory. Find out how to [create or update contacts](LINK).

To add a contact from a directory:

1. Go to ‘More’ at the top of Whitehall Publisher.
2. Select ‘Organisations’ and find the organisation that owns the contact. Select ‘View’ next to their name.
3. Go to the ‘Contacts’ tab and copy the relevant ‘Markdown code’.
4. Paste the code into your document.

You can remove the contact details by deleting the code.

If you do not want to use the contact directory, use the [formatting guidance](LINK) to add contact details.

## Change the ‘first published’ date

You can change the first published date if the same publication was available on another webpage before.

Under ‘First published date’, tick the ‘This document has previously been published on another website’ box. Select the new date.

The new date will show when you publish the draft.

## Add or remove tags to organisations, people and events

Under the main body, you can tag your publication. You do this by adding or removing associations.

These associations include:

- ministers – use this if a government minister has had direct involvement with the content, like if they wrote a foreword
- statistical data sets – use this if the publication is associated with a [statistical data set](LINK)
- topical events – use this if you want the publication to appear on a [topical event page](LINK)
- world locations – use this if you work for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and you want the publication to appear on a [world location news page](LINK)
- lead and supporting organisations – your own organisation will be set as a lead organisation as default, but you can change that or add any other organisations if they’re responsible for the publication

> If you’re publishing transparency data, check if there’s relevant [‘How to publish’ guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/how-to-publish-central-government-transparency-data) which includes the associations you need to use.

## Update settings of the draft

You have the option of:

- changing the ‘Email address for ordering attachment files in an accessible format’
- selecting ‘Schedule publication’, if you want the draft published on a certain date – you’ll still need to get someone to approve the draft or force schedule it yourself
- selecting ‘Review date’, if you want to get an email asking you to check the content at a later date after you’ve published it

## Add or remove topic tags

You need to tag your publication to at least one topic page before you can publish it.

Your publication will appear on the tagged topic pages automatically when it’s published. [See an example of a topic page](https://www.gov.uk/education).

To add tags:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Topic taxonomy tags’ heading, select ‘Add tags’ or ‘Change tags’.
3. Select the boxes next to each topic that applies. The arrows next to each topic will expand the topic out, showing all sub-topics in that topic ‘tree’.

To remove tags, select ‘Remove topic’ next to the one you want to remove.

Choose topic tags:

- based only on what the content is about
- from anywhere in the topic ‘tree’, not just the areas that your organisation uses the most

Try to choose the most low-level topics you can.

You can tag your content to as many topic pages as are relevant. There’s no limit.

## Add or edit translations

### Add a new translation

Read the [guidance about deciding whether to add a translation](LINK).

If you do want to add a translation:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft. 
2. Under the ‘Translations’ heading, select ‘Add translation’.
3. Add the translated title, summary and body.
4. Select ‘Save’.
5. Under the ‘Attachments’ headings, select ‘Modify attachments’.
6. Edit any existing attachments and change the ‘Display language’ to English.
7. Add translated attachments and select the relevant translation under ‘Display language’.
8. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on the ‘Document’ tab.
9. Check the translations are working by selecting ‘Preview translated pages’ under the ‘Preview’ heading.

> If you’re adding a translation for a language that is written from right to left, there’s a different way to [format links](LINK).

### Edit an existing translation

If you want to update the title, summary or body of a translation:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft. 
2. Under the ‘Translations’ heading, select ‘Edit’ next to the relevant translation.
3. Make the changes and select ‘Save’.

If you want to update the attached publication:

1. Go to the ‘Attachments’ tab at the top of the draft of the English version.
2. Select ‘Edit attachment’ under the relevant attachment.

## Update the URL

URLs are automatically created from the page title when you first publish the content. You might want to update the URL if there’s a typo or if it no longer reflects the content.

If you have not published the first draft, you can update the draft title and the URL will change.

If you’ve already published a draft, you can:

1. Create a new publication with the desired title and URL.
2. Copy over the content from the current publication to this new draft.
3. Publish the new draft.
4. [Unpublish the page](LINK) with the incorrect URL and set up a redirect to the new page.

The change notes history will be lost if you do this. If you need to keep that, [contact GDS](LINK) and ask them to change the URL instead.

## Publish the draft

Find out how to [send the draft for review](LINK).

If you need to publish it urgently without a review, find out when you can [publish your own draft](LINK).
