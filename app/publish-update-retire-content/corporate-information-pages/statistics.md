Use this page if you want to list your statistics collection. You can also link to [the research and statistics search page](https://www.gov.uk/search/research-and-statistics), filtered to just your organisation.

If you create a ‘statistics at [organisation]’ page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘about us’ pages.

Make sure your statistics page follows the GOV.UK [style guides](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/) and [tone of voice](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/).
