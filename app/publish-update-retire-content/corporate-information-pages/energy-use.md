Only create an ‘Our energy use’ page if the organisation collects and publishes regular data about its energy use. 

Only use the page to publish information about the organisation’s energy use.

Do not use this page for guidance on how to reduce energy consumption or general information about carbon emissions. 

If you create an ‘energy use’ page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘about us’ pages.

Make sure your energy use page follow the GOV.UK [style guides](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/) and [tone of voice](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/). 

## What to include 

For the summary, adapt this text:

> Details of [organisation name]’s energy use at our headquarters building (or say which building(s) you’re providing information about).

Include your energy use data, linking to one or more of the following:

* live data hosted on an external website
* data files hosted on www.data.gov.uk
* data files attached to the page

Say which building or buildings you’re providing data for. You do not need to give information on the size and space of rooms. 

If the organisation has a Display Energy Certificate, you can attach it directly to the page.

You can also add information about what the organisation is doing to reduce its energy use. If you do, make sure to:

* use bullet points
* give brief details of specific measures, not general aspirations
* attach any documents setting out the organisation’s energy-saving commitments in detail (for example a ‘Greening government’ publication)
