Use a ‘working for’ page to describe:

* what sort of roles you might recruit for
* the benefits to working for your department, such as travel, holiday, pension
* training and development opportunities
* the benefits of working for the Civil Service
* a link to Civil Service recruitment or other relevant recruitment websites

View [a good example of a ‘working for’ page](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency/about/recruitment).

If you create a ‘working for’ page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘about us’ pages.

Make sure your ‘working for’ page follows the GOV.UK [style guides](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/) and [tone of voice](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/).
