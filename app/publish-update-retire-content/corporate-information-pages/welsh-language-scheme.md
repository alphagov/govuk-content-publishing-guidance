Use this page to explain the organisation’s Welsh language scheme, if it has one. 

If you create a Welsh language scheme page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘about us’ pages.

## What to include

For the summary, use this text:

> We treat the English and Welsh languages equally when conducting public business in Wales.

For the body, adapt this text:

> Our Welsh Language Scheme explains what [organisation name] does to make sure the English and Welsh languages are treated equally when we provide public services in Wales.

Add the English then Welsh versions of the scheme as an attachment to the page. Do not include any other information.
