The terms of reference of an organisation or group describe its aims, structure and how it will work. They outline the objectives of the group, and the roles and responsibilities of those involved.

If you create a terms of reference page, a link to it will appear automatically in the ‘Corporate information’ section on your organisation and ‘about us’ pages.

Make sure your terms of reference page follows the GOV.UK [style guides](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/) and [tone of voice](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/).
