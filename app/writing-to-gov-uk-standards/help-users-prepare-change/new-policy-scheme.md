If a new policy or scheme is being introduced users will have to do something for the first time, such as apply for a new visa or use a new service.

### Update or create guidance

Check your [content audit](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) to see if there’s existing guidance that meets the user need.

You’ll need to either:

+ update the existing guidance with the new information
+ create new guidance if there’s no existing content with the same user need

### When to publish guidance in advance

If users need to prepare for the change, publish some content before the change comes into effect.

The content you publish in advance should tell users:

+ what they must do to prepare for the change (for example, register for a scheme)
+ when they need to take action to prepare
+ the date the change will come into effect

### When changes announced in advance come into effect

You’ll need to:

+ update the guidance to reflect the new policy or scheme - this might include content linking to a new service
+ publish the updated guidance when the change comes into effect

#### Example

In 2018, the government announced that EU citizens would need to apply for a new scheme called ‘settled status’ to continue living in the UK after 2020. 

Even though users did not need to do anything immediately, they needed to know what their options were well in advance as it would have a major impact on life decisions.

[New settled status guidance was published on GOV.UK](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20180807221702/https://www.gov.uk/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) in 2018 explaining who would be affected and what the process would involve.
