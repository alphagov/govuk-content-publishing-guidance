A change to an existing policy or scheme means users will have to do something they do now in a different way, such as apply online instead of by post.

### Update existing guidance

Because it’s an existing policy or scheme, there should already be guidance about it on GOV.UK which you can update. Check your [content audit](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) to see where this sits.

Do not create new guidance if some already exists that meets the user need. You should update the existing guidance instead.

### When to update the existing guidance in advance

If users need to prepare for the change, publish some content before the change comes into effect.

The content should succinctly tell users: 

+ what they must do to prepare for the change (for example register for a scheme or apply for a licence)
+ when they need to take action to prepare
+ the date the change will come into effect

This will usually be a call out with one or two sentences or a short paragraph with a subheading.

### When the changes announced in advance come into effect

You’ll need to:

+ update the guidance to reflect the new policy or scheme - this might include content linking to a new service
+ publish the updated guidance

#### Example

In 2016, a new process for filing for bankruptcy came into effect which was easier and cheaper for users. They needed to know about the new process before it came into effect because it could have changed their decision on when to file for bankruptcy. 

A call out was added a few weeks before the change happened:

>From 6 April, you'll have to apply online to the Insolvency Service to become bankrupt. This will be cheaper than applying to the court. If you have an existing application you must send it to the court before 6 April.

Before the new policy came into effect, the Government Digital Service (GDS) worked with the Insolvency Service to:

+ rewrite the [guide on bankruptcy](https://www.gov.uk/bankruptcy) to reflect the new policy
+ remove the call out informing users in advance

The rewritten content was published on the day the new policy came into effect.
