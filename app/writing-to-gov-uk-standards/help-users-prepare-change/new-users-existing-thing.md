title: If a new set of users must do an existing thing for the first time
description: Plan updates to GOV.UK guidance if an existing policy or scheme is about to apply to new users.

This is where a policy or process changes so that it applies to a wider group of people. This means new users will need to do an existing thing for the first time. 

For example, rules for doing things internationally outside the EU may start to apply to people or businesses currently doing those things inside the EU in a different way.

### Update existing guidance

There should be existing guidance about the task or service that the new users need to complete. Check your [content audit](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/manage-existing-govuk-content/) to see where this sits.

You'll need to restructure or rewrite parts of the guidance to meet the needs of the new users as well as existing users. 

Prioritise the needs of the new users because the processes, tasks and services involved are likely to be completely new to them. 

If there's a big increase in the number of users affected, [raise a ticket with the content team at the Government Digital Service (GDS)](link tbc) to see if content needs to be moved from Whitehall to mainstream.
