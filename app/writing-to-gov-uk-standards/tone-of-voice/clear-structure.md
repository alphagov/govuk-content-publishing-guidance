People read content on the web differently. They will often skim it and not read every sentence.

For example, most people will:

- [only read 20 to 28% of text on a webpage](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/), and can skim even more out of impatience
- [read a webpage in an ‘F’ shape pattern](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/) – they look across the top, then down the side, reading further across until they find what they need

Users may also be stressed or under pressure and want to find an answer quickly. For example, they could be on a busy train or be experiencing a difficult family event.

Creating content with a clear structure will help users get tasks done quicker and avoid wasting their time.

## Frontload your content

Put the most important information first. The quicker you get to the point, the greater the chance your users will see the information you want them to.

You can then taper down to smaller and smaller details as your content goes on. This is sometimes called an ‘inverted pyramid’ approach.

## Break up the text with headings

The page title will be an H1 (heading level 1), so you can use H2s, H3s and H4s in your content. Read about [how to format headings](link tbc).

Write headings that are:

- descriptive – avoid generic headings like ‘Introduction’
- frontloaded – put the most important information first
- active – for example, start them with a verb when possible, like “Apply for a driving licence” rather than “You can apply for a driving licence”
- removable – the content should still make sense with the headings removed

Headings should not:

- be questions – they’re hard to frontload and users want answers, not questions
- use technical terms, unless you’ve already explained them

You do not need to have text between headings, but they can be helpful to provide context.

When you link to a service, make sure the start button is under a heading which relates to the start button’s task. For example, a heading like ‘Apply online’.

## Use bullet point lists and steps

Bullet point lists and steps can:

- reduce duplication 
- make lists easier to read

See the [style guide A to Z](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) for information about how you should format bullet points and steps.

## Avoid footnotes

Do not use footnotes in your content. They’re designed for reference in print, not webpages.

If the information in the footnotes is important, include it in the body text. If it’s not, leave it out.

## Do not repeat yourself

You’ll have to [write a summary](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/summaries/) to go at the top of the page.

Do not repeat the summary in the first paragraph.
