Along with the title, the summary is usually what users see in search results. It should give them a clear indication of what the content is about. 

Make sure people can see quickly whether the page will have the information they need.

## Use clear and common language

Make summaries user focused, clear and descriptive so that users can distinguish if it's the right content for them.

Like when writing a title, you can find out what words users will be familiar with by [looking at common search terms](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/find-tools-resources/find-out-terms-users-searching/). You can choose common words for the summary that you have not already used for the title.

This will also help make your content easier to find.

## Keep your summary short

Keep all summaries to 160 characters, including spaces. Google usually only shows the first 160 characters in search results.

If your summary is longer, make sure you cover the main point of the page in the first 160 characters.

## Include punctuation

Summaries should end with a full stop. It can help people who use assistive technology like screen readers.

## Avoid redundant introductory words

Do not mention the content type in the summary. For example, do not say 'this consultation is about…' or 'a form to…'.  

Use as few words from the title as possible, and include keywords that you've not used in the title.

## Use active language

Keep summaries active and include a verb. 

You can use words like 'How…', 'What…' and 'When…' to introduce active words. For example 'When applying for a…'.
