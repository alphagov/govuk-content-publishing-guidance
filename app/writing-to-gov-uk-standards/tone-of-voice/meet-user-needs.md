Before you start writing, [identify a user need](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/identify-user-needs/).

Publish only what's needed to meet that user need and nothing more. 

For example, if you're creating guidance, only include what someone needs to know so they can complete a task.

This will help your content be:

* specific
* informative
* clear and to the point

A website only works if people can find what they need quickly, complete their task and leave without having to think about it too much.
