You can add links to body text, but not in titles, summaries or subheadings. Read about [how to format links](link tbc).

## Choose which links to use

Do not duplicate information. If it exists elsewhere on GOV.UK, you can link to it instead.

You can also link to non-GOV.UK websites in these circumstances:

- you’re linking to a government service or website
- a user can only complete a task using a third party website – for example, finding a driving instructor 
- there is evidence a user needs something that cannot be published on GOV.UK – for example, information or advice that the government cannot or does not provide 
- a trustworthy source can support users better than GOV.UK can – for example, it has a tool or feature that GOV.UK does not

If you’re including an external link, then:

- link to a specific page, not the website's homepage
- users must be able to access the content without having to pay or register to see it
- you must have a reason for linking to one commercial website instead of another if they provide similar information
- check the site is usable and accessible (especially on mobile)
- check that the site is a safe place to send users by reading the site’s privacy and cookie policies
- plan how you’re going to maintain the link – the content might stop being useful, or links can break or redirect to other inappropriate sites

When adding links to your content:

- link to online services first, unless an offline alternative is better for your users
- do not include the background site hosting information in the URL – this might be included if you copy and paste the URL from an external source like an email
- if it’s a GOV.UK link, do not link directly to attachments but instead to the publication page (the page the attachment is added to)
- if it’s a non-GOV.UK link, try to avoid linking directly to documents – link to the page that hosts the document and give the full name of the document they need to look at

## Add links in appropriate places

Make sure all links are provided in context, at the point in the content at which they're useful.

Do not:

- put all the links together at the bottom of the page
- use unsorted lists like “Further reading” or “More information” to link off to content the user might be interested in
- swamp users with too many links 
- link to the same place constantly throughout your page

## Write clear link text

When writing link text:

- make it descriptive and avoid generic text like ‘click here’ or ‘more’
- frontload it with relevant terms
- do not make it too short, as it can make links harder to click – if you have one-word link text, try to use a word with at least 3 syllables
- do not reuse the same link text to link to different pages
- if you have more than one link to the same page, use identical link text or similar link text that conveys the same meaning
- tell users if the link will take users off GOV.UK – for example, “Find a counsellor on Counselling Directory”
- mention if you’re linking to a page in a different language – for example, “guidance on driving in France (in French)”
- include the file format and size if you need to link directly to a document – for example “Application form (PDF, 19.5KB)”

If your link leads to information rather than starting a task, use the text about that information as the link. For example, ‘accessibility testing’. Consider using the title of the page the link goes to as your link text.

If your link takes the user to a page where they can start a task, start your link with a verb. For example, “Send a tax return”.

## Be careful with ‘anchor’ links

Anchor links are used to take a user to a particular section of a page. 

They can take users to either:

- another section on the same page
- a section on a different page

If possible, try to avoid using anchor links in your content. They can be disorientating for some users with accessibility needs.

If it’s a link to another section on the same page, rearrange the structure of your content so that people can navigate the content more easily.

If it’s a section on a different page, there may be instances where an anchor link is needed. For example, if users only need to read an annex of long, complicated guidance.

If you have to do this, make it as accessible as possible by making the link as descriptive as possible. This is so that users know what they will see on the destination page. For example, “read Annex A of the EU spouse visa guidance to check your eligibility”.

The link text must give clues to: 

- where you are sending them - “the EU spouse visa guidance”
- what they need to do when they get there - “read Annex A of the EU spouse visa guidance”
- why they are going there - “to check your eligibility”

## If you’re linking to a third party service that will collect personal data

Only use the third party service if your organisation has approved its use. This includes if you’re linking to survey websites like SurveyMonkey or SmartSurvey.

If in doubt, ask your organisation’s data protection team.
