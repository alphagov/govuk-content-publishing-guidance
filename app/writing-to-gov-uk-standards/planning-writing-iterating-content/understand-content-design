Good content design allows people to find out what they need to know or do quickly. Users come to GOV.UK to find information or complete a task. The content on GOV.UK should be designed to help users do this. 

This guidance sets out some basic principles of good content design and links to further information on each. In summary, well designed GOV.UK content should:

* start with user needs
* take into account the amount, format and best place to publish your content
* be written to GOV.UK style
* be properly maintained

##Start with user needs

Content design starts by taking a user need and presenting it on GOV.UK in the best way possible.

A user need is something that a user will need to do or find out from government, such as:

* working out whether they’re eligible to claim a benefit
* registering to vote
* checking their tax code or state pension
* applying for a passport or driving licence

Before publishing to GOV.UK, you need to know your users’ needs and design your content around them. Read more about this in the guidance on [identifying user needs](link needed).

##Think about what and where you’ll publish

Depending on what your user needs are, you may need to:

* reduce the amount of content you plan to publish
* split one big piece of content into smaller pieces
* change the format of the content
* put some content in the Mainstream area of the site
* remove content from the site, to avoid duplication or conflicting information
* publish your content elsewhere, like a blog, partner site or social media

There’s more on this in the guidance on [planning new GOV.UK content](link needed).

##Design clear and accessible content

Good GOV.UK content is clear, written in plain English and optimised for the web. Government content must be accessible to anybody who needs to use it. 

Our [style guide](link needed) and [tone of voice guidance](link needed) are designed to make our content meet these standards. Check that your content is written in line with them before you publish it.

You should also check the guidance on [making your content accessible](link needed) - this will help with the accessibility of headings, links and other formatting elements.  

##Content maintenance

Content on GOV.UK should be current and meet a user need. That said, there’s also a transparency need for an available record of things we’ve published that do not reflect current policy or guidance. We also have a statutory duty to publish some types of content and leave them up. 

The guidance on [managing existing GOV.UK content](link needed) explains more about how you should maintain your content.
