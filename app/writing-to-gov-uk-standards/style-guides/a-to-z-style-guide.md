## A

### A*, A*s

The top grade in A levels. Use the symbol * not the word ‘star’. No apostrophe in the plural.

<details class="govuk-details">
  <summary class="govuk-details__summary">
    <span class="govuk-details__summary-text">
    Evidence for A*, A*s
    </span>
  </summary>
  <div class="govuk-details__text">
  Evidence content

### A-level

No hyphen. Lower case level.

## B

### Bacs (Bankers Automated Clearing System)

Acronym should come first as it’s more widely known than the full name. Please note that the acronym has changed to Bacs.

### Bank details

When adding bank details:

* do not use a table - use bullet points and a lead-in line instead
* use spaces rather than hyphens in sort codes - 60 70 80 (not 60-70-80)
* avoid using spaces in account numbers unless they are very long (like an International Bank Account Number)

For example:

> Transfer the fee to the following account within 5 working days of emailing your form:
>
> * sort code - 80 26 50
> * account number - 10014069
> * account name - The Public Trustee
