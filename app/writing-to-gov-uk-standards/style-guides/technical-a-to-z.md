lastUpdated: 
---

This section only covers style conventions for technical content on GOV.UK.

If you cannot find something, look at the [style guide A to Z](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) which covers style conventions for all content on GOV.UK.

If you want to suggest a change, read the [guidance on how to use the style guide](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/how-to-use/).


## A

### API

Do not expand the acronym for technical users.

### API endpoints

Use `methodname endpoint` for an API endpoint. Do not include the base path. Use {CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES_INSIDE_CURLY_BRACKETS} for placeholder parameters in endpoints.

For example:

GET /v1/payments/{PAYMENT_ID}/{REFUND_ID} 

Replace:

- `{PAYMENT_ID}` with the ID of the payment you’re checking  
- `{REFUND_ID}` with the ID of the refund you’re checking

### API headers

There are lots of HTTP and API headers, so use code style and the exact name of API headers, to make it clear which header you mean. For example:

- `Authorisation` header  
- `Content-type` header - not `Content header` because there are several different content headers

Example:

You must include an `Authorisation` header in your request.

### API key

Do not expand the acronym for technical users. Use:

- create an API key – not generate  
- revoke an API key

### API parameters and fields

Use:

- parameter for API request items, not ‘option’
- field for API response items, not ‘variable’ 
- object, not ‘dictionary’ or ‘array’ – for example: If the `status` in the `refund_summary` object is `available`...
- key
- value
- key-value pair

Parameters are required or optional. Do not use 'you do not need' (which is ambiguous) or 'you can leave out'.

### API requests

Use ‘API request’ not ‘API call’.

Tell users they can ‘include’ a parameter in an API request, not that they can ‘supply’ a parameter.

## B

### bold

Only use [bold in text from interfaces](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/#bold).

### breaking changes

‘Breaking changes’ are changes to one part of your software system that may cause other parts to fail. Do not use this term without explaining it – user research shows not all technologists immediately understand what it means.  

{% include "layouts/shared/back-to-top.njk" %}


## C

### choose

Use 'choose' where there's a genuine choice (like 'choose what time you want your appointment') and 'select' when you're indicating the appropriate response (like 'select your year of birth').

### Cloud First policy

Capitalise Cloud First.

### Cloud Security Principles

Upper case. 

### code samples

Format code samples or excerpts in a fixed width font. You usually do this by adding either:

- backticks (```) around code excerpts inside sentences   
- 3 backticks (````````) above and below code blocks 

### code styling

Use code styling for the following, which is based on the [code styling list in Google’s style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/code-in-text):

- classes, methods and functions
- terminal commands
- fields - names and values
- data types
- filenames, extensions, paths and folders
- HTML element names
- HTTP status codes
- HTTP methods - for example GET and PUT
- placeholder variables

### conditions

Use:

- ‘you must’ for a requirement
- ‘you should’ for a recommendation
- ‘you can’ for an option or possibility

Do not use:

- it may be possible to - use ‘you can’
- you may want to - use ‘you can’
- where possible you - use ‘where you can’

Do not use block capitals. It’s an accessibility issue, and user research shows that it does not help users recognise and understand requirements.

### credential issuer

Write 'credential issuer' the first time you refer to a credential issuer. You can then use 'issuer' throughout the content.

Do not abbreviate 'credential issuer' to ‘CI’ or 'CRI'.

### CSS

Do not expand the acronym.

### custom

We use this to mean ‘your own’, for example in:

- add a custom paragraph
- add custom metadata

## D

### data type

Not ‘datatype’.

### data

Use the following:

- get data
