## Help with writing and sharing content

The [GOV.UK style guide](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) covers the style, spelling and grammar conventions for all content published on GOV.UK.

If you want details about the word count and estimated reading time of published content, you can use [Content Data](https://content-data.publishing.service.gov.uk/content).

Reading time is calculated by dividing the word count for the page by an average reading speed of 200 words per minute. The time it takes to read the page is rounded up to the nearest minute. This calculation does not take into account how complicated the content is or include any of the page’s attachments.

If you want help with avoiding common writing mistakes, you can use [Hemingway Editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) to identify long sentences, adverbs, passive voice and complicated words.

If you want to spot jargon, you can use the [Jargone bookmarklet](http://rooreynolds.github.io/jargone/). This is a browser bookmarklet for highlighting jargon words on any page. Just because Jargone flags something does not necessarily mean it’s banned in that context – check the [GOV.UK style guide](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/).

If you want to easily take and share screenshots, [Awesome screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en) is a Google Chrome application that can capture, annotate, save and share screenshots.

## Help with searching content

Use [Govsearch](https://gov-search.service.gov.uk/) if you want to search GOV.UK content for:

- specific keywords or phrases
- specific links
- relationships to organisations, topic tags, publishing applications and language

## Help with finding content on Whitehall Publisher

If you want to go straight from a page on GOV.UK to its corresponding admin page on Whitehall Publisher, you can use the [‘Find in admin’ bookmarklet](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/find-in-admin-bookmarklet).

You’ll need a [Signon account with access to Whitehall Publisher](link tbc) to use this bookmarklet.
