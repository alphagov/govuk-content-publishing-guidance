The GOV.UK content and publishing guidance includes guidance, information and standards about writing and publishing content on GOV.UK.

The GOV.UK content and publishing guidance is provided by the [Government Digital Service (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service/about), which is part of the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT). The data controller for GDS is DSIT - a data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed.

[Read DSIT’s entry in the Data Protection Public Register for more information](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/ZB546218).

## Performance analysis

We also carry out performance analysis to see how you use the GOV.UK content and publishing guidance and how well the site performs on your device during your visit – we do this to make sure it is meeting the needs of its users and improve it.

The legal basis for performing web analytics is your consent. You will be asked for your consent when first landing on the page. If you do not give it, you will still be able to use the page.

If you have signed up to our mailing list, your email address will only be retained while you choose to remain on the list. You can unsubscribe at any point using the link in the email alert.

## Where your data is processed and stored

We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.

Your personal data may be transferred outside the United Kingdom while being processed by GDS. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal protection as you are within the United Kingdom.

- share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.

## How we protect your data and keep it secure

We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access to or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties that process personal data for GDS are required to keep that data secure.
