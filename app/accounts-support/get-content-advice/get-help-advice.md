## Support from the Government Digital Service (GDS)

You can ask for content advice from the GDS content team. This could be about, for example:

* which [content type](/publish-update-retire-content/choose-content-type/) to use
* following the [GOV.UK style guides](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/) and [tone of voice](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/tone-of-voice/)
* structuring your content
* checking if content fits the [GOV.UK proposition](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition)
* designing [accessible content](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/create-accessible-content/make-content-accessible/)

It may be a quick question about content you’re working on or a request for a formal response you can share with colleagues in your organisation. To help GDS prioritise the work, you need to:

* clearly explain what you need
* give a deadline

## Support from across government

As well as contacting GDS, you can get help from content colleagues across government. 

Basecamp has a [government content community group](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/projects/15005645) which includes content designers in other departments and agencies. You can use this to ask for advice and tips on publishing. To join, ask someone who’s already a member to invite you.

UK government digital Slack - also known as ‘cross-government Slack’ - is another cross-government communications platform. You can ask questions of other content designers in the ‘#content’ channel, and use other channels for other communities. To join, you need to [sign up for a new account](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/signup#/domain-signup).
