If your department has built a new service, it may need a service assessment. [Read the Service Manual to find out if it needs an assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-need-to-meet-service-standard).

If the service is having an assessment, you’ll need to get its content reviewed.

The Government Digital Service (GDS) can review the content if the service will be both:

* linked to from a mainstream page
* having a beta assessment

GDS can also sometimes do reviews at the live assessment stage if the content has changed a lot since the beta assessment.

If GDS cannot do the review, get someone in your department to do it instead.

## How to ask GDS for a content service review

Send in the request at least 4 weeks before the date of the service assessment.

Use the [content requests form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new) and select ‘service review’ as the reason for the request. 

Include the following information:

* whether the service is in alpha, beta or live
* the date of the assessment
* the date you need the review by
* a link, username and password for the prototype of the service
* email addresses for the lead assessor and design assessor

You should also:

* copy in the coordinator from your departmental assurance team
* send over the service briefing document - you can do this once you get an email telling you that a ticket has been opened
