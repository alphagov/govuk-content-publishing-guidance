description: The Production publishing environment is for publishing live content to GOV.UK, while Integration is not live, so you can use it for practising or testing content.

The GOV.UK publishing applications have 2 environments - Production and Integration. 

You need sign in details and 2-step verification (2SV) for each environment.

Use:

+ the [Production publishing environment](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/) to publish content live to GOV.UK
+ the [Integration publishing environment](https://signon.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/) to practise or to test content

Content on Integration is overwritten weekly in the early hours of Monday morning with what’s in Production. This means anything you’ve saved in Integration will be lost.

Content marked ‘access limited’ is not brought across from Production to Integration.
