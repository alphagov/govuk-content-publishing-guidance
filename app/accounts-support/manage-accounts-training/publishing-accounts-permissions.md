You need a Signon account to access GOV.UK publishing applications such as Whitehall Publisher and Specialist Publisher. You also need it to get help through GOV.UK Support.

Your GOV.UK lead or an organisation admin can [request training and accounts](link tbc) for you.

## Types of Whitehall Publisher permissions

If you have a ‘writer’ account you can create Whitehall content but you cannot publish it. 

When you get your account, you’ll have ‘writer’ permissions.

If you have an ‘editor’ account, you can create and publish Whitehall content and you can review (2i) content submitted by others.

If you have a ‘managing editor’ account, you can:

+ create, publish and 2i Whitehall content
+ [unpublish, withdraw and unwithdraw Whitehall content](link tbc)
+ [change your organisation page layout](link tbc)

Most organisations are limited to 5 managing editors and 5 organisation admins, who can be the same people.

Your GOV.UK lead or an organisation admin can make or request changes to your permissions.

They can read the guidance on [managing accounts for your organisation](link) to see how to do this.
