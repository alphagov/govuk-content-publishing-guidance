If you’re a GOV.UK lead, organisation admin or super organisation admin, you can request new Signon accounts and training for people in your organisation.

## Request a new account

To submit a request for someone, use the [create new user or request training form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/create_new_user_or_training_request/new).

You can say what publishing application you’re requesting access to and request training at the same time.

For Whitehall Publisher, new publishers must complete ‘Writing and Publishing on GOV.UK’ training before they can have an account.

New publishers who only have access to Manuals Publisher, Specialist Publisher or Travel Advice Publisher have the option of doing ‘Writing for GOV.UK’ training.

To get a Google Analytics account, your organisation’s analytics ‘single point of contact’ (SPOC) will need to [raise an analytics ticket](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/analytics_request/new). If you do not know who your SPOC is, you can raise an analytics ticket yourself to find out.

## Required training for Whitehall Publisher

What training someone can get depends on if they’re a new or existing publisher.

### New publishers

To request ‘Writing and Publishing on GOV.UK’ training for new publishers, use the [create new user or request training form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/create_new_user_or_training_request/new).

New publishers need to complete one of the following training courses:

+ Writing and Publishing on GOV.UK for press officers - if they only need to publish news articles and press releases
+ Writing and Publishing on GOV.UK - for all other content types

Together you’ll need to follow these steps:

1. The GOV.UK lead or an organisation admin requests training through the [create new user or request training form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/create_new_user_or_training_request/new).
2. They’ll be automatically enrolled on to the training course - they can set up their account on the training platform using the link in the email inviting them to complete the course.
3. They’ll be invited to set up their account on the [Integration environment](link tbc) (if they do not already have one).
4. Once they’ve finished the course, the GOV.UK lead or the person who requested their account must check they’ve successfully completed the training.
5. If they’ve successfully completed the training and are a new publisher, the GOV.UK lead can request their account for the Production environment using the [create new user or request training form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/create_new_user_or_training_request/new).
6. They’ll be invited to set up their account on the Production environment within 2 days.

If you’re a GOV.UK lead or an organisation admin, you’ll be given a checklist and example content to check if a new publisher has successfully completed the course. You’ll be given access the first time you request training for a new publisher.

### Existing publishers

You can request refresher training for a publisher who uses Whitehall Publisher using the [create new user or request training form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/create_new_user_or_training_request/new).
