If you have organisation admin permissions, you can do the following for people in your organisation:

+ [request training and accounts](link tbc)
+ view their accounts and the applications they have access to
+ unsuspend accounts
+ reset their 2-step verification
+ resend their account signup emails
+ manage access and permissions for some applications (for example, access to Manuals Publisher or the ‘editor’ permission in Whitehall Publisher)
+ change their personal or organisation details
+ [remove their account](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/remove_user_request/new)

You cannot give anyone the ‘managing editor’ permission for Whitehall Publisher. You must submit a request using the [accounts request form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/change_existing_user_request/new) instead.

## How to get organisation admin permissions
Ask your GOV.UK lead to make a request using the [accounts request form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/change_existing_user_request/new).

Super organisation admins can do all the same things as other organisation admins, but for all sub-organisations that your organisation looks after.

You can get super organisation admin permissions if you manage the accounts of people in your department’s agencies who have access to GOV.UK tools. 

## View your organisation’s accounts
You manage your users through the [‘Users’ tab in the Signon dashboard](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/users).

You can then search for a specific name or email address, or filter your users by their:

+ account status - active, suspended, invited or locked
+ 2-step verification (2SV) status - enabled, not set up or exempted
+ role - normal user, organisation admin or super organisation admin
+ access to publishing apps and permissions

You can export a CSV of your users to see what permissions they have across all applications.

## Unsuspend and unlock accounts
You need to select an individual user account to unsuspend or unlock their account. 

On the user account page, there are 2 relevant links below the ‘Actions’ heading:

+ ‘View account access log’
+ ‘Unsuspend user’ or ‘Unlock account’

The account access log will show you the account history, for example if they’ve entered an invalid password or if they’ve successfully logged in.

The unsuspend link will take you to another screen. You need to untick the suspended box and save to unsuspend the user’s account.

The unlock account link will only appear when a user’s account is locked. Click it to unlock an account.

You can only unsuspend and unlock accounts in your department’s sub-organisations if you’ve got the super organisation admin permission.

## Reset 2-step verification (2SV) on accounts
Select an individual user account to reset their 2SV. Select ‘Reset 2-step verification’ under the ‘Actions’ heading.

The user will be prompted to set up 2SV again the next time they sign in.

## Resend signup email
Select ‘Resend signup email’ under the ‘Actions’ heading. This will automatically resend the signup email.

## Manage access and permissions for applications
You’ll need to have access to the application to give (‘grant’) access or manage permissions for another user account.

You can manage permissions for:

+ Content Data - grant or remove access
+ Contacts - grant or remove access
+ GovSearch - grant or remove access
+ Local Links Manager - grant or remove access
+ Manuals Publisher - grant or remove access, add or remove ‘editor’ permission
+ Places Manager - grant or remove access
+ Specialist Publisher - grant or remove access, add or remove ‘editor’ permission
+ Support - grant or remove access, add or remove permissions for content advice and request forms (‘content_requesters’) and campaign request form (‘campaign_requesters’)
+ Whitehall Publisher - add or remove ‘editor’ permission

For any other applications, you need to submit a [change user account request](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/change_existing_user_request/new) to change permissions for an account.

To change permissions for an account, select an individual user account in the ‘Users’ section of Signon and then select ‘Manage permissions’ under the ‘Actions’ heading.

To give access to an application which the account does not have access to already, select ‘Grant’.

To remove access to an application, select ‘Remove’ and select ‘Confirm’ on the confirmation page.

To add a permission for an application:
Select ‘Update’ under the ‘Permissions’ heading.
Select the permissions you want to add to the account.
Select ‘Update permissions’ to save the changes.

To remove a permission for an application:
Select ‘Update’ under the ‘Permissions’ heading.
Find the permission and untick the box for the permission.
Select ‘Update permissions’ to save the changes.

## Change personal or organisation details

To change someone’s details on an existing account, you can [submit a request](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/change_existing_user_request/new).

This includes personal details such as surname and the organisation.
