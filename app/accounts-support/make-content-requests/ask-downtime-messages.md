If your service is going to be down for 2 hours or more, you should add a downtime message to GOV.UK content that links to it.

You should also add a downtime message to the service itself if possible.

## Who to ask for a downtime message

Who you ask depends on where you want to add the downtime message.

To add a downtime message to the service itself or to 'Whitehall' content, ask your organisation's GOV.UK publishing team to do it for you.

To add a downtime message to 'mainstream' content, ask the Government Digital Service (GDS).

Content is mainstream if it:

- does not have ‘government’, ‘guidance’ or ‘find-licences’ in its URL
- is not part of a specialist finder, like any of the content in [‘Air Accidents Investigation Branch reports’](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)

## How GDS adds downtime messages

Most downtime messages will take this format:

‘This service will be unavailable from [date and time] to [date and time].‘

If the service is down and you do not know when it will be up again, GDS can use one of the following:

- ‘This service is currently unavailable.‘
- ‘This service will be temporarily unavailable from [date and time].‘

GDS generally does not add downtime messages to mainstream content if:

- the downtime is very short – under 2 hours (unless you send data showing it would affect a high number of users)
- it’s requested too late
- there may be intermittent problems but no expected downtime
- the service is only partially down – the service should present the downtime message in the appropriate place
- the request is sent out of hours – GDS will make changes during working hours for scheduled and unscheduled downtime

## Asking GDS for downtime messages

You need to be the GOV.UK lead for your organisation to make the request.

Ask for the downtime messages 5 working days in advance of the downtime. Give GDS as much time as possible if more than one service is affected. They’ll always try to give users at least a day’s notice of downtime.

Use the [content requests form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new) to make the request.

In your request, include:

- the URLs of the pages which need the message and the position of the link to your service on the page
- the date and time the service will be down
- the date and time the service is going back up (if you know)
- whether or not the downtime is confirmed
