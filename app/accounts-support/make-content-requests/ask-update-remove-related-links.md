Some Whitehall Publisher content has related links which are shown on the right hand side of the page. 

You cannot request to add related links to content that does not have any related links. If there’s a need to link to content, consider adding it to the main body of the page where users are more likely to find it.

If content does have related links, you can ask the Government Digital Service (GDS) to:

* update them, if there’s a user need
* remove them

You must include:

* why the content needs to be in the related links section
* why the user need cannot be met by adding the link to the main body of the content
* any supporting evidence or insights 

Use the [content advice support form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_advice_request/new) to make your request. 

Requests to update related links are reviewed on a case by case basis.
