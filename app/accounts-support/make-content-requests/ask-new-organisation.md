[[toc]]

The Government Digital Service (GDS) will only set up organisation pages for:

* brand new organisations
* organisations that have changed name (for example, when the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities changed to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government)
* organisations that are becoming part of government (what we call transitioning)

Sub-organisations are a type of organisation. GDS will ask for some extra information for sub-organisation page requests.

Only a GOV.UK lead or managing editor in your organisation can request a new organisation or sub-organisation page.

## Asking for a new organisation page

If you’re requesting a new organisation page, include in your request:

* the new organisation’s name
* the organisation’s acronym (if it has has one)
* if the organisation uses a single identity system (‘crown crest’) logo or a custom logo approved by the Government Communications Service (GCS)
* how the logo should be formatted, for example stacked or written out in full (if using a government single identity system logo)
* if there’s a parent organisation
* any other sponsoring organisations
* an email address for users to request accessible formats of published attachments
* if the organisation is exempt from GOV.UK, the URL of the organisation’s website
* the type of organisation

### Types of organisation

Types of organisation include:

* ministerial department
* non-ministerial department
* executive agency
* executive non-departmental public body
* advisory non-departmental public body
* special health authority
* tribunal
* court
* public corporation
* independent monitoring body
* other - for example companies owned by government, regulators and independent organisations
* sub-organisation (typically large units within organisations)

## Asking for a new sub-organisation page

Sub-organisations are large units within organisations which, while they formally exist under the governance of their parent organisation:

* have the properties of a separate organisation
* are seen by the public as having a separate identity

[Border Force](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/border-force) is an example of a sub-organisation. 

To qualify as a sub-organisation, a unit should:

* be well-known and public-facing (there should be evidence that the public are searching for it by name)
* have a regular output of content, published under its name (rather than that of the parent department)
* have a clear mission statement and corporate structure separate from its parent organisation (for example a board, reporting directly to a permanent secretary or minister)
* be contactable directly by the public

GDS will expect a sub-organisation to have:

* a publishing team with the resource to manage their profile page and content
* a parent department who agree that a separate corporate online presence is essential to the implementation of their digital strategy

## How to make your request

Use the [content advice support form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_advice_request/new) to make your request.

## What happens after you make a request

GDS will review your request. If your request is approved, GDS will create a new organisation page with the ‘coming soon’ status to allow you to [create, edit and add content to your organisation page](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/organisations/) before it goes live.
