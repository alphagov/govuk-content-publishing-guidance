Most Whitehall content needs to be tagged to a topic before it can be published.

If there’s no topic that describes what your content is about, you can ask the Government Digital Service (GDS) to create a new topic.

You can also suggest changes to an existing topic.

You need a Signon account to make these requests. Speak to your GOV.UK lead if you want access.

## Add a new topic

Use the [new topic request form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/taxonomy_new_topic_request/new) to make your request.

You need to include:

* evidence of why a new topic should be created, if you have any
* where you think the new topic should sit within the topic taxonomy – for example, if you think it should be a subtopic of an existing topic
* examples of pages you think should be tagged to the new topic

## Suggest changes to an existing topic

Use the [suggest topic changes request form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/taxonomy_change_topic_request/new) if you want to:

* rename a topic
* remove a topic
* reposition a topic in the topic taxonomy – for example, move it up a level
* merge with another topic
* split a topic into multiple topics
