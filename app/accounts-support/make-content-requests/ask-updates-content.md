## When to ask the Government Digital Service (GDS) for help

There are different ways to ask for a change depending on whether you want to work on ‘Whitehall’ or ‘mainstream’ content.

Whitehall content is managed by your organisation’s GOV.UK publishing team. You need to contact them to create or update Whitehall content. They can get [content advice from GDS](link tbc) if they need help with that.

Mainstream content is managed by GDS. You need to ask them to create or update mainstream content. We explain how to do that in the following guidance.

### If you’re not sure whether you’re working on Whitehall or mainstream content

If you want to create new content, read our [guidance on planning new content](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/plan-new-govuk-content/) to decide whether you want Whitehall or mainstream content.

If you’re updating existing content, you can tell if something is mainstream content if it:

- does not have ‘government’, ‘guidance’ or ‘find-licences’ in its URL
- is not part of a specialist finder, such as any of the content in [‘Air Accidents Investigation Branch reports’](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)

For example, the [‘Register to vote’ guide](www.gov.uk/register-to-vote) is mainstream content.

## Prepare your request for GDS

GDS can work on your request faster if you include:

- a clear title that explains what needs to change – for example, ‘Update phone numbers on Universal Credit guide’
- the section of content that needs to change – for example, ‘Overview chapter, first paragraph’
- the reason for the change – how it helps meet [user needs](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/plan-manage-content/identify-user-needs/)
- how many users are affected (if you know)
- the consequence for the user if the change is not made – for example, a user misses out on a benefit they’re entitled to because the eligibility criteria are wrong
- evidence to support the change – for example, call centre feedback, user research or policy changes
- any deadlines or embargoes, and why – for example, an upcoming policy change or a new service launch

If it’s urgent, you should also include:

- URGENT in the title of the request
- explain the impact on users if the issue is not resolved quickly

Explain as much as you can in the request itself. Write your request clearly and in plain English. Avoid abbreviations, jargon and legal language.

It's fine to suggest wording if it helps to explain what's changed. However, the GOV.UK content team cannot put your copy straight onto GOV.UK, even if it's 'signed off'. They’re responsible for presenting information in a way that users will understand.

## Submit your request to GDS

Use the [content requests form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new). 

You need a Signon account with ‘content requesters’ permissions to access the form. Speak to your GOV.UK lead if you want access to the form.

### If you need emergency support

You can only ask for emergency support with a request if the public or government is facing immediate and significant financial, legal or physical risk because of an issue with mainstream content.

That might be:

- an inaccurate figure in a guide (for example, student loan rates)
- incorrect application dates for a government scheme
- misleading information about benefit eligibility
- a link to an online service which has had its security compromised
- linking to a service that people rely on for information about their immediate safety (for example, flood warnings)

You cannot get emergency support for:

- routine updates
- last minute publication of factual information on government schemes
- information about unscheduled service downtime

You should just raise these as ‘urgent’ requests instead, and they’ll be picked up during working hours.

If you need emergency support, complete the request form as usual and then use the [GOV.UK emergency contact details](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/emergency-contact-details) to flag it to GDS. You’ll need a Signon account to access those details.

Emergency support is available at any time.

## What happens after you submit your request

You'll get a confirmation email with a Zendesk ticket number.
 
If you need to update the request, follow the link in the confirmation email.
 
Read about the [steps involved in getting something published](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/how-content-requests-from-government-get-published/mainstream-content-publishing-process).

### How your request is prioritised

Small changes will usually be made the same day if they do not need a fact check. These are things like:

- phone numbers 
- postal addresses
- email addresses
- opening times for phone lines
- fees
- a supplier on a list

If the same update needs to be made to the Welsh version, this will be done at the same time. 

All other requests will be sent to the GDS team that works with your organisation. That team will prioritise your request against their other requests according to:

- any deadlines
- the impact on the user
- whether the change is about factual accuracy or about improving wording
- any evidence you provide that supports the requested change

If you’re asking for a new Welsh version of existing mainstream content, your request is more likely to be prioritised if:

- the content allows an end-to-end journey in Welsh – in particular, to a Welsh language government service, offering offline support for Welsh language users if needed
- there’s evidence people in Wales are using a central government service

### If you asked for new or updated Welsh mainstream content

GDS will copy your Welsh language team into the Zendesk ticket. They will be asked to create and upload the Welsh language translation if you’re from one of these organisations:

- Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)
- Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)
- HM Land Registry
- HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)
- justice departments – including Ministry of Justice (MOJ), HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS), Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), Legal Aid Agency (LAA)

If you’re from a different organisation, GDS will send the current English version of the content in a document. You will need to arrange for someone to translate it.

Add the translated content to the document, keeping the same formatting code. This will help to keep the formatting consistent, and it will allow GDS to publish the content more quickly. Replace links to English content with links to Welsh content, where they’re available.

Send the document back to GDS for them to publish.

If it’s new Welsh content, GDS will add it to the [Welsh index](https://www.gov.uk/cymraeg).
