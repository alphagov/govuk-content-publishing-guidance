You can ask for your content to be featured on the GOV.UK homepage.

Featured slots are planned and updated regularly by the GOV.UK team to ensure they are timely, topical and relevant to user needs. All requests are reviewed by the director of GOV.UK.

To get a featured slot, your content must:

- be high profile (for example, the Budget)
- be time sensitive (for example, pay your Self Assessment tax return)
- have a significant impact on a large number of people
- usually communicate a clear action for the user to take
- meet GOV.UK content standards 
- be on GOV.UK or a domain covered by the GOV.UK proposition

Your featured slot may be removed without warning in the event of a major incident. 

The 'Popular on GOV.UK' section is based on user data and is regularly updated by the GOV.UK team. It is not possible to request a change to this section.

## Asking for a featured slot

Ask for a featured slot using the [content requests form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/content_change_request/new). 


>[!NOTE]
>You need a Signon account with ‘content requesters’ permissions to access the form. Speak to the lead of your GOV.UK publishing team if you want access to the form.

Send the request at least 4 working days before you want the featured slot to go live. 

When you make your request, you need to include:

- a clear and specific title for the content – ideally no more than 25 characters long
- a one sentence description for the content – ideally no more than 75 characters long
- the link to the content – make sure the content is up to date and follows the GOV.UK style guide
- the date you want the link to go live (and removed if appropriate)
