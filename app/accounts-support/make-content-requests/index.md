You sometimes need to contact the Government Digital Service (GDS) to add or update certain content on GOV.UK. This guidance will explain how to do that.

This guidance covers how to request:

- [changes to GOV.UK content](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-updates-content/)
- a [new or updated topic page](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-changes-topics/)
- a [downtime message for a service](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-downtime-messages/)
- a [short URL](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-short-url/)
- a [featured slot on the GOV.UK homepage](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-featured-slot-homepage/)
- [changes to related links](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-update-remove-related-links/)

It also covers how to request an [exemption from putting your content on GOV.UK](/accounts-support/make-content-requests/ask-exemption/).

There’s separate guidance about how to request:

- a [blog site](/publish-update-retire-content/promotional-social/blogs/)
- a [campaign site](/publish-update-retire-content/promotional-social/campaigns/)
- a [group page](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/groups/)
- a [manual](/publish-update-retire-content/other-content-types/manuals/)
- a [ministerial role page](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/people-roles/)
- an [organisation page](https://guidance.publishing.service.gov.uk/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/organisations/)
- a [specialist finder](/publish-update-retire-content/other-content-types/specialist-finders/)
- a [topical event page](/publish-update-retire-content/promotional-social/topical-events/)
