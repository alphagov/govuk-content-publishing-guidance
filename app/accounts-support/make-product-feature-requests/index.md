Product requests are changes to the:

- look or functionality of a GOV.UK publishing application
- way the site looks or works

You can send product requests to the Government Digital Service (GDS).

GDS cannot always make changes because they need to make sure the change:

- supports good publishing practice
- meets the needs of the majority of publishers using that application
- meets the needs of general GOV.UK users
- can fit within the work on the product roadmap

Most product changes will need evidence to support them or may need user research, so GDS cannot always make the change right away or tell you when it can be made.

Product changes that cannot be made are:

- grouped and categorised for future roadmap work
- reviewed regularly against the evidence supplied

## How to make a request

Use the [product feature form](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/changes_to_publishing_apps_request/new).

[!NOTE]
> You need a Signon account to access the form. Speak to the lead of your GOV.UK publishing team if you want access to the form.

You should include:

- who the change would affect, for example publishers or the public
- what the problem is
- how big the problem is, for example if it stops you from publishing
- how changing something would help the users affected
