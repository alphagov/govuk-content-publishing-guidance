If a GOV.UK application stops working or you get an error, you can report it to the Government Digital Service (GDS).

Before reporting a fault, check the [GOV.UK status page](https://status.publishing.service.gov.uk/) to see if the problem is already being dealt with.

If it’s not on there, [report a technical fault](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/technical_fault_report/new).

>[!NOTE]
>You need a Signon account to access the form. Speak to the lead of your GOV.UK publishing team if you want access to the form.

When you report it:

- give as much context as possible
- include links to the content you’re trying to publish or change
- take screenshots of the problem (if possible) and send them as attachments in reply to the acknowledgement email you get after submitting the form

## If it’s an urgent fault

Urgent faults are things like bugs that affect the site’s usability or your ability to edit and publish content. 

If the fault is urgent, report the fault as usual but:

- write URGENT in the title of the report
- explain the impact on users if the issue is not resolved immediately 

If GDS becomes aware of a problem affecting large numbers of GOV.UK publishers, they will post regular updates on the [Basecamp community](https://3.basecamp.com/4322319/projects/15005645). Read about [how to access the Basecamp community](/accounts-support/get-content-advice/get-help-advice/).

## If you need emergency support

Emergency support is available at any time.

You can only ask for emergency support if the public or government is facing immediate and significant financial, legal or physical risk because of the technical fault.

If that’s the case, submit the form and then use the [emergency contact details](https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/emergency-contact-details) to contact GDS.

Do not ask for emergency support if you’re just reporting a general issue with publishing functionality.
