Official documents are types of papers that are laid before (presented to) Parliament. These include:

- command papers
- House of Commons papers
- unnumbered act papers

> [!NOTE]
> Find out more about these different document types in [guidance on official documents from the National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/producing-official-publications/parliamentary-papers-guidance/types-parliamentary-paper/). They call them ‘parliamentary papers’ rather than official documents, but they’re the same thing.

You should create and attach HTML and ‘web’ and ‘print’ PDF/A versions of these documents. For help with that, read the [guidance on planning ‘web-optimised’ and ‘print-ready’ papers from the National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/producing-official-publications/parliamentary-papers-guidance/parliamentary-papers-planning-checklist/).

All versions of official documents must contain the: 

- title
- copyright owner (HTML versions are Crown copyright unless you state otherwise, for example: ‘© Financial Conduct Authority’)
- ISBN reference

You’ll need to add additional details to the document depending on what type of official document they are.

## Command papers

Command papers must also have:

- a statement to explain how the paper was presented to Parliament, such as: ‘Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Transport by Command of His Majesty’
