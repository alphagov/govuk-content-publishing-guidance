Read the guidance on [choosing the right file type](/formatting-content/attachments/choose-attachment-type-name/). This recommends you save any form attachments as both ODT and another editable format like DOCX or PDF.

Creating a form using the ODT file type has limits. For example, you will not be able to add graphics or complicated steps to your form.

## Write instructions for the form

Include simple instructions in your form. Clear labels on form fields will help the user follow instructions. The simpler you can make your form, the fewer instructions you'll need.

If your form requires a lot of instructions, put them in a separate attachment. If you're working on the publication content type, add the instructions as an HTML attachment.

## Avoid certain elements

It is best to remove as much formatting as possible in an ODT form. 

The ODT file type does not have radio buttons. Use tick boxes instead.

A table with multiple columns can be difficult to navigate in any format. When a user is zoomed in, it's often difficult to see if you have a 'two question, two answer column' format. Build your forms in a normal reading layout, with one column for questions on the left and one for answers on the right to avoid this problem.

You should not use nested tick boxes because they can create access problems for screen reading software. Make your tick boxes into a list or redesign the question to avoid this problem.

## Do not use macros

Macros are sets of actions in a document or spreadsheet that can be automated and repeated.

You should not use macros in attachments because there are:

- security issues with macros
- accessibility issues with macros – an attachment containing a macro cannot be saved as an ODT file

For alternatives to macros, read about how to 'Reduce your dependence on macros' in the [guidance on using macros from the National Cyber Security Centre website](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/macro-security-for-microsoft-office).

## Make numbered lists manually

You should add the numbers manually in a list as automatic listing will add more numbers as users add their answers. You can stop your editing software from creating automatic lists by clearing formatting, and then typing in the number you need.
