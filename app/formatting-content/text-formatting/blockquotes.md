Blockquotes should only be used in news articles and case studies, and only for quotes longer than a few sentences.

Do not use blockquotes in speeches.

In news articles and case studies:

- introduce the blockquote with a colon
- leave one empty line space above and below your blockquote
- add '>' in any line spaces in the quote – if you leave it out you'll get separate quotes on separate lines, not one running quote

For example:
```
> This is the first line of the blockquote.
>
> This is the second line.
```
Looks like this:
> This is the first line of the blockquote.
>
> This is the second line.
