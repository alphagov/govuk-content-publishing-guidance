Put [^n] into the sentence where you want to create the footnote, where ‘n’ is the number for the footnote.

On a new line break, or at the bottom of the page, put [^n]: followed by the content for your footnote.

For example:

```
This is part of the body text [^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote.
```
If your footnote text needs to be more than 1 paragraph long, indent the start of each new paragraph by 4 spaces.
