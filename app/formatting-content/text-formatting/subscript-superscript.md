For subscript, put `<sub>` before the word you want to appear in subscript, and `</sub>` afterwards.

This is an example of what ~subscript~ looks like.

For superscript, put `<sup>` before the word you want to appear in superscript (without a space), and `</sup>` afterwards (also without a space).

This is an example of what ^superscript^ looks like.

You should use subscript and superscript for scientific notation and measurements, like chemical names or metres squared.
