For addresses, use the code $A above and below the address text.

For example:
```
$A
10 Downing Street
London
SW1A 2AA
$A
```

Looks like this:


$A
10 Downing Street
London
SW1A 2AA
$A

Do not use bold for the address title. This is not accessible because it looks like a heading and can be confusing for users of assistive technology.

See the 'Addresses in the UK' section of the [A to Z style guide](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/#addresses-in-the-uk) for more information on writing addresses.
