To create a bullet point list:

* use asterisks `*` or hyphens `-` to make bullets 
* make sure there is a space after the asterisk or hyphen
* leave an empty line space before the bullets start, and one after

For example:

```
Leave a line below this:

* then an asterisk for a bullet
- or use a hyphen
```

See the ‘Bullet points and steps’ section of the [A to Z style guide](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) for more information on style and punctuation for bullet points.
