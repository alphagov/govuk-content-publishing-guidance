description: Add abbreviations and initialisms to your GOV.UK content so they include accessible alt text.

Add acronym code so that when a user hovers over an abbreviation they see the full name as 'alt text'.

You should:

- go to the end of the body copy to add the code, leaving one empty line space above it
- type an asterisk, square brackets around the acronym, a colon and then the full name - for example: `*[DWP]: Department for Work and Pensions`
- make sure there is no space between the asterisk and the square bracket

When you have more than one acronym, list:

- each one on a new line
- both plurals and singulars, but not possessives – for example, do not list 'DfT's' if you already have 'DfT'
- plurals ahead of singulars – for example, 'HGVs' before 'HGV'

See the 'Abbreviations and acronyms' section of the [style guide A to Z](/writing-to-gov-uk-standards/style-guides/a-to-z-style-guide/) for more information on using acronyms.
