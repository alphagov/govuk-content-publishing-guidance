You can format text through 'Govspeak', a simplified version of 'Markdown' code. You can use it in body content and HTML attachments.

When you edit content, you'll usually see a quick guide to this code under 'Formatting' on the right of the screen.

You can convert most formatted text from your own documents into 'Govspeak' code by either:

- copying and pasting the text into the publishing app
- using the [Govspeak converter](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/)
