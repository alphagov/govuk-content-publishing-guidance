Make sure you’ve correctly [formatted the images](https://www.gov.uk) before you add them.

Select the ‘Images’ tab at the top of the page. You can add images from here. Each image will need a unique file name.

Once you add an image, you’ll be given a ‘Markdown code’ that you can copy and paste into the body or HTML attachments.

If you want to remove an image, you can remove its code from the body or HTML attachments. You can then upload a new version of an image and use its code instead.
