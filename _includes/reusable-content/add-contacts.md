You can add contact details using your organisation's contact directory. That means if the details in the directory are updated, they'll automatically update in your content too.

Your organisation's most used contact details should be in the contact directory. Find out how to [create or update contacts](/publish-update-retire-content/organisations-people/organisations/#contact-details).

To add a contact from a directory:

1. Go to 'More' at the top of Whitehall Publisher.
2. Select 'Organisations' and find the organisation that owns the contact. Select 'View' next to their name.
3. Go to the 'Contacts' tab and copy the relevant 'Markdown code'.
4. Paste the code into your document.

You can remove the contact details by deleting the code.

If you do not want to use the contact directory, use the [formatting guidance](/formatting-content/) to add contact details.
