URLs are automatically created from the page title when you first publish the content. You might want to update the URL if there’s a spelling mistake or if it no longer reflects the content.

### If the content has never been published before

You can update the draft title and the URL will change.

### If the content has been published already

You can:

1. Create a new piece of content with the desired title and URL.
2. Copy over the current content to this new draft.
3. Publish the new draft.
4. [Unpublish the page](LINK) with the incorrect URL. When you unpublish it, you’ll be able to set up a redirect to the new page.

The change notes history will be lost if you do this. If you need to keep that history, [contact the Government Digital Service (GDS)](LINK) and ask them to change the URL instead.
