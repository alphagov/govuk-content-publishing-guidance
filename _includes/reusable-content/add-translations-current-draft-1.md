Read the [guidance about deciding whether to add a translation](LINK).

If you do want to add a translation:

1. Select 'Save and go to document summary' on your current draft. 
2. Under the 'Translations' heading, select 'Add translation'.
3. Add the translated title, summary and body.
4. Select 'Save'.
5. If you want to add any translated attachments, go back to the English version and add the attachments there. You can then copy the code and paste it into the translated version.  
6. Check the translations are working by selecting 'Preview translated pages' under the 'Preview' heading.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're adding a translation for a language that is written from right to left, there's a different way to [format links](LINK).
