When you add attachments:

- use the official title of the document
- do not tick 'Attachment is accessible' – this means users can ask for the attachment in an accessible format like audio or Braille

For each attachment, you get 2 codes that you can add to the body. You can either add the attachment as:

- an 'inline' link – this means you can add a download link to the middle of a sentence or in a bullet point list
- a 'publication box' – this means you will have a separate section with a download link, alongside information about how to request the attachment in an accessible format

Read the [formatting guidance](LINK) for more information about the different types of attachment code and when they should be used.
