You need to tag your draft to at least one topic page before you can publish it.

Your content will appear on the tagged topic pages when:

- the draft is published, if it’s new content
- you save the new tagged topic pages, if you’re updating existing content

See [the ‘Education, training and skills’ topic page](https://www.gov.uk/education) for an example of what these topic pages look like.

To add tags:

1. Select ‘Save and go to document summary’ on your current draft.
2. Under the ‘Topic taxonomy tags’ heading, select ‘Add tags’ or ‘Change tags’.
3. Tick the boxes next to each topic that applies. The arrows next to each topic will expand the topic out, showing all sub-topics in that topic ‘tree’.
4. Select ‘Save’.

To remove tags, select ‘Remove topic’ next to the one you want to remove and then select ‘Save’.

Choose topic tags:

- based only on what the content is about
- from anywhere in the topic ‘tree’, not just the areas that your organisation uses the most

Try to choose the most specific topics you can.

You can tag your content to as many topic pages as are relevant. There’s no limit.
