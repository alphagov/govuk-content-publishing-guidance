Make sure you've correctly [formatted the images](/formatting-content/images-videos/formatting-images/) before you add them.

Select the 'Images' tab at the top of the page. You can upload images here. Each image will need a different file name.

Once you upload an image, you'll be given a 'Markdown code'. You can copy and paste that into the body and the image will appear there.

If you want to remove an image, you can remove its code from the body. You can then upload a new version of the image and use its code instead.
