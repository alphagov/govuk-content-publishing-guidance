You can change the first published date if the same content was available on another webpage before, like on another GOV.UK page you’re unpublishing or a campaign site you’re closing.

Under ‘First published date’, tick the ‘This document has previously been published on another website’ box. Select the new date.

The new date will show when you publish the draft.
